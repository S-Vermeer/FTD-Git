#TS: 31:32. Calls out because someone has been knocking. In the bathroom (?). When she opens the door no one is there, but there is a note on the ground, written in red crayon saying 222 church street on one side and Go ! :) on the other. Sunny assumes that the [[The Stranger|The Stranger]] wrote it due to the handwriting and red crayon, and that it wants her to go to the location. Mentions how she does have a car and can drive there. Says how she is going to keep her car doors locked at all times, not going out of the car and carrying pepper spray.
