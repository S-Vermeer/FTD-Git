Dear [[Michael]],

You remember [[John]] who lives in that [[Trailer]] near my house? I haven't heard from him in a few weeks. If you see his car coming down the road, let me know. He never picked up his cash I left him from helping me build my well. It would be a shame if something bad happened to the poor guy. Please keep me updated. You're always welcome at our house.
