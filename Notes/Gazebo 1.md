For Florence,

Sapphire eyes burning through my skin.
A cold glacial freeze
Bullets through my heart one after another
You beautiful thing

Of all the days for you to meet me here
To see me like this in the rain
Why today, covered in earth, why today

Pure from the mist
You opened my eyes and damned me
Just as well

Love cannot quite cover 
what I'm plagued with at the hands of you


On the back it says: I broke my own rule.
