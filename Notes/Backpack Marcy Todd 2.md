[[Marcy Todd]]- 
It is your fault that [[Sophie Perry|Sophie]] is missing. If it hadn't been for you leaving her unattended, you could've seen who took her. I bet you were doing drugs somewhere with other rejects from God. I have yet to see you in church, begging God for forgiveness for what you alone have done. I hope you are happy.
