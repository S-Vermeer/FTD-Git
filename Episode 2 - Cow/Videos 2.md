#TS: 17:50
In the [[Basement]], continuation after [[Videos 1||Episode 1]].
[[Sunny]] asks the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] what she is looking for. The stranger responds with "You'll know"
#TS: 18:02 
There is a paper in a white miniature house/church thing. Sunny shows it to the stranger and asks whether this is it, the stranger replies to "keep looking, there's more". 
#TS: 18:20 #morse `... --- .--. .... .. .` : Translation = [[Sophie Perry|Sophie Perry]]. Sunny asks if it is the same morse code as before (end of episode 1), and the stranger responds with yeah. It has moved from the chair to the doorway.

Pretty flowers!! or Music book! ^bsc-1
#TS: Majority voted book. Book is called the Broadman Hymnal. The paper is hidden on song 382 or 383. The songs shown are He Ransomed me by J.W. Henderson and He Died of a Broken Heart by T. Dennis

Pretty flowers ->:\[ or The bell for sure ^bsc-2
#TS: 19:16 Sunny finds a paper under what seems like a praying golden angel. 
#TS: 19:20 Majority says flowers. They are red and white fake flowers with lights in them, but do not contain a paper.
Sunny asks the stranger if the three papers found are it, but the stranger replies No, from a different doorway. 

Bell for sure or Search the ashes. ^bsc-3
#TS: 19:47. Majority said under the bell. There is a paper there. 
#TS: 19:58. She asks the question for where to look next, the ashes or the toy car, but as she is pointing out the car, you can already see the paper and she says that it is definitely in the car. 

Ashes kinda sus or Coffee grinder sus ^bsc-4
#TS: 20:07. While Sunny is asking where to look next, the stranger appears behind her and says 'There's twelve' two times.
#TS: 20:18. Majority voted ashes. Sunny removes protective covering and finds a paper in the ashes. 

Coffee grinder or Piano Bench ^bsc-5
#TS: 20:34. Majority vote said Piano Bench. It is filled with a bunch of stuff, amongst which a paper. It also has a note, but it was later verified to be unrelated, Ashby is the name of Auggie's cousin. However, there is a reference to a 'paw paw' which was **not** a nickname that Sunny gave her grandpa. 
#TS: 20:49. Goes to show the new choices, but spots one in the frame of a painting. 
#TS: 20:55. Again, goes to show off choices but spots one next to the coffee grinder and some sort of home sound system, a picture of someone in a white dress and some sort of ash tray with in it a pack of matches, some coins and the paper.
#TS: 20:58. Looks up at the coffee grinder and sees a paper sticking out of it.

Goes to search some more, nothing between the pillows or in the red glass ornament on the piano. #TS: 21:16. Goes to say she pretty much looked everywhere but then spots one hanging in the bell with an anchor behind it. 

Kettle or Piano ^bsc-6
#TS: 21:28. Majority voted Kettle. Contains a pair of cards (4 of hearts and 7 of hearts), a shell, and a coupon but no paper. Goes to check the piano and finds it along with a #TS: 21:44 google docs link written by a child in red crayon. The stranger is no longer in the room. Sunny calls out 
to it whether she can ask it about it, but no response.

#TS: 22:22, Shows all the papers saying the same thing written in red crayon, #morse morse code for Sophie. Also shows the document with the link. 
It is almost 2AM for Sunny so goes to sleep.
#TS: 21:11 It is morning, Sunny has translated the link.

Should I trust the stranger? Yes or No ^sidt-6
Sunny is debating whether or not to trust the stranger. She is not as scared of it as she used to be, but is unsure if it is pulling her into a trap or helping her.

#TS: 23:34. Was searching in the [[Basement]] during the day to spot anything she missed, sees opened bag of canine carry outs on the ground. These are the dog treats she got for [[Grimm]], they are open and half of them are gone. They don't have any pets in the house.

Goes to see grim, walking over a sunny path with a positive attitude. Has brought the treats.
#TS: 24:03. [[Grimm]] is the goodest boy and gets a treat.
Should I follow the dog: Yes or No ^ftd-3
Follows Grimm to a field. Grimm goes to grab a stick.
#TS: 24:34. Sunny finds tiny little headstones at the side of the field. Grimm is gone. The [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] shows up and says that it is a [[Pet Cemetery]]. Sunny is frightened because the stranger snuck up on her. Scene cut and then Sunny goes to explain and Grimm is back and the stranger is nowhere to be found. 
#TS: 25:03 Walking home, Sunny explains that before disappearing, the stranger explained that the pet cemetery belonged to 'the man in trailer'. Sunny points out the [[Trailer]], saying that it means that a man used to live there and she is not going to investigate there now because she is not in the mood to deal with whatever scary things are there. She doesn't know if someone is living in there right now. Based on this clue, Sunny wants to do research on who lived there before and whether they knew [[Sophie Perry|Sophie]] and whether Sophie had anything to do with the trailer.

Grimm is walking home, done for the day. Sunny says she is going to do some more investigating.

#TS: 26:07. Sunny sitting in front of something where a paper written in red crayon is visible. It says [[Grocery]] and the amounts as well as the O for onions show the number combination 8439046517. Sunny thanks everyone for the art and the help, and suggests making a discord to solve the mystery together and talk to others who want to solve it. 

Should I make a discord?: Yes or No ^sidt-7

#TS: 26:29. Discord link + closer look at contents from the kettle from the [[Basement]]. The coupon was for a high school, american school, At home in your spare time - No classes. Diploma awarded. Mail coupon today for free information. There are matches inside.

#TS: 26:44. Is about to go to the barn, because everyone wants her to. Throat is hurting and she's not feeling too great.

#TS: 26:59. Sun is setting while she is approaching the [[Barn]]. Keeps hearing barking, but that is not that unusual around here because there's a lot of dogs in the area and they do have neighbours. Sunny is getting very bad vibes at the barn. Decides to take a break and go somewhere else first. 

#TS: 27:39. Shows the [[FTD-Git/Locations/Gazebo]] and the path that goes around the [[Lake]]. Mentions that her [[Sunny's Grandpa - Marvin||Grandpa]] dug this lake by hand. 
#TS: 27:53, Sunny is frightened, asking us if we heard that. Goes really quiet and at #TS: 28:15 we hear something high pitched. Sunny asks us to tell her what it is, hoping it is a bird.
#TS: 28:26. Sees a [[Backpack]] on the [[Bridge]] near the [[Gazebo]]. Mentions that it was not here the other day. Takes it with her.
#TS: 28:32. Quiet, mentions how the vibes are horrible 'out here'. Searched the whole [[Backpack]] and found a very upsetting message. [[Backpack Marcy Todd 1]]. Sunny reads the note to us.
#TS: 29:23. It is getting dark, and she doesn't feel comfortable being out here for too much longer, but sunny asks us in an open chat box whether there is anything else she should do. In the caption she also says that there is another note in the [[Backpack]]. ^ocb-5
#TS: 29:34. Has a note in her hand. Says how it sounds nuts but she would feel a lot safer if the stranger would show up.

A response to the chatbox is to 'Go around the trailer and try to see if theres any movement around'. Sunny says she would but the trailer is pretty far away and the sun is very much setting. Isn't really ready to be out there in the complete dark.
Another response is to check if there is anything in the bag. Shows a flashlight, which was the only other thing found in the bag. 
Another response was to go back home, then read the rest of the note there if you feel safer :). Sunny mentions how the last thing she wants to do is disappoint us. 

Should I Go? Yes or No ^sidt-8
#TS: 30:25, points out to where the trailer is, is debating going but is unsure. 
Thanks everyone who voted No, and goes to read the second note found in the [[Backpack]] [[Backpack Marcy Todd 2]]. Sunny summarizes that the [[Backpack]] probably belonged to [[Marcy Todd]]. She thinks the placement of the [[Backpack]] was purposeful for her to see. Thinks the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] put it on the [[Bridge]] for Sunny to see. 

#TS: 31:32. Calls out because someone has been knocking. In the bathroom (?). When she opens the door no one is there, but there is a note on the ground, written in red crayon saying 222 church street on one side and Go ! :) on the other. Sunny assumes that the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] wrote it due to the handwriting and red crayon, and that it wants her to go to the location. Mentions how she does have a car and can drive there. Says how she is going to keep her car doors locked at all times, not going out of the car and carrying pepper spray.
#TS: 32:37. Says she lied about getting out of the car. Shows the [[Trinity Church]]. It is very spooky looking especially at night. It does not look burnt down, but behind what is visible it is completely destroyed. There is a barbed wire fence around it. Against the fence there is a note ([[Math - gewswz]]) on the ground. 
#TS 33:17. Sunny is puzzled because it has math on the back. 

#TS: 33:57, Sunny came outside and the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] is just standing there by the [[Lake]]. Per suggestion of the discord to befriend the stranger, has brought a gift. It is a plushie with a horn (narwhal?) Stranger goes to eat the horn, but Sunny stops it. Stranger looks at it and says "Cow". Sunny says that it is not a cow, that's Phillip. Stranger goes to pat it, and says "Cow" again. Sunny laughs a little and says, yeah. Cow. 

#TS: 34:46. [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] suggests that Sunny should go to the [[Trailer]]. Sunny asks "right now?" and the stranger nods. Sunny grabs a golf cart and goes away.
