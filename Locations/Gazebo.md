First location choice: Gazebo or [[Barn]], majority chooses barn.
After Sunny runs away from the barn due to a stranger smiling weirdly, she goes to look at the Gazebo.

Backstory for the gazebo: Parents got married there. It's very old now. Its {little tech thing here, maybe sayings its oak}.  [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] appears behind Sunny and says "I wouldn't step foot in that if I were you." You can hear Sunny stepping on something wood and freezing. When Sunny turns around the stranger is gone. Sunny is spooked and goes to look for the black dog again.

Though Sunny wants to ask the stranger why she shouldnt go to the gazebo, she cant find him anymore.
