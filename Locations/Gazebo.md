It is located over the [[Bridge]] over the [[Lake]]

First location choice: Gazebo or [[Barn]], majority chooses barn.
After Sunny runs away from the barn due to a stranger smiling weirdly, she goes to look at the Gazebo.

Backstory for the gazebo: Parents got married there. It's very old now. Its {little tech thing here, maybe sayings its oak}.  [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] appears behind Sunny and says "I wouldn't step foot in that if I were you." You can hear Sunny stepping on something wood and freezing. When Sunny turns around the stranger is gone. Sunny is spooked and goes to look for the black dog again.

Though Sunny wants to ask the stranger why she shouldnt go to the gazebo, she cant find him anymore. 

[[Gazebo 1]] was found there, the song sapphire bullets of pure love, addressed to 'florence' and on the back 'I broke my own rule.'

The Stranger described the gazebo with 5 red crosses, indicating it is extremely dangerous, at least to sunny. It is also one of the locations that the stranger responded cow to when asked about dangerous locations.

When someone sent the following message to the stranger:
*gazebo :[https://open.spotify.com/track/3VOrUgVDqhY20TahZMK90H?si=74057b8a7d9e475e](https://open.spotify.com/track/3VOrUgVDqhY20TahZMK90H?si=74057b8a7d9e475e "https://open.spotify.com/track/3VOrUgVDqhY20TahZMK90H?si=74057b8a7d9e475e")* 
It responded with: 💀 🐄🪦
Which is different from the other songs that were sent, namely just a cow emoji.

*And at the gazebo….bullets of pure love. And then the letter which reads kind of like a poem between lovers. So maybe someone got shot there?* Cow
*Did Sophie go missing because of the gazebo?* No
*or was she last seen there??* No

The gazebo was most likely built around 2005-2006
