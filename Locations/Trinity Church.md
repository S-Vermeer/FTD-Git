#TS: 31:32. Calls out because someone has been knocking. In the bathroom (?). When she opens the door no one is there, but there is a note on the ground, written in red crayon saying 222 church street on one side and Go ! :) on the other. Sunny assumes that the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] wrote it due to the handwriting and red crayon, and that it wants her to go to the location. Mentions how she does have a car and can drive there. Says how she is going to keep her car doors locked at all times, not going out of the car and carrying pepper spray.
#TS: 32:37. Says she lied about getting out of the car. Shows the church. It is very spooky looking especially at night. It does not look burnt down, but behind what is visible it is completely destroyed. There is a barbed wire fence around it. Against the fence there is a note  ([[Math - gewswz]])  on the ground. 
#TS 33:17. Sunny is puzzled because it has math on the back.
