First location choice, Barn or [[Gazebo]]
There is a person sitting at the barn. Majority votes to go there. The [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] smiles weirdly as Sunny approaches and Sunny bolts.

Location choice, [[Trailer]] or Barn. Majority votes Barn.
Sunny sees some lumber, some pots and flowers, that look like they are being taken care of. The table and chairs from earlier. No sign of the stranger. She can see a lot of tires, tractor supplies and an old slide. Just a lot of farm materials. Also something on wheels, but all of it feels really off.

There is a pretty field next to the barn that looks like they used to have cattle or something.
When Sunny calls out to the stranger near the barn, they are met with radio silence.

#TS: 26:44. Is about to go to the barn, because everyone wants her to. Throat is hurting and she's not feeling too great.

#TS: 26:59. Sun is setting while she is approaching the barn. Keeps hearing barking, but that is not that unusual around here because there's a lot of dogs in the area and they do have neighbours. Sunny is getting very bad vibes at the barn. Decides to take a break and go somewhere else first.
