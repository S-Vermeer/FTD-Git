First location choice, Barn or [[Gazebo]]
There is a person sitting at the barn. Majority votes to go there. The [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] smiles weirdly as Sunny approaches and Sunny bolts.

Location choice, [[Trailer]] or Barn. Majority votes Barn.
Sunny sees some lumber, some pots and flowers, that look like they are being taken care of. The table and chairs from earlier. No sign of the stranger. She can see a lot of tires, tractor supplies and an old slide. Just a lot of farm materials. Also something on wheels, but all of it feels really off.

There is a pretty field next to the barn that looks like they used to have cattle or something.
When Sunny calls out to the stranger near the barn, they are met with radio silence.
