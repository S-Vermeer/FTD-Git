First location choice, Barn or [[FTD-Git/Locations/Gazebo]]
There is a person sitting at the barn. Majority votes to go there. The [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] smiles weirdly as Sunny approaches and Sunny bolts.

Location choice, [[Trailer]] or Barn. Majority votes Barn.
Sunny sees some lumber, some pots and flowers, that look like they are being taken care of. The table and chairs from earlier. No sign of the stranger. She can see a lot of tires, tractor supplies and an old slide. Just a lot of farm materials. Also something on wheels, but all of it feels really off.

There is a pretty field next to the barn that looks like they used to have cattle or something.
When Sunny calls out to the stranger near the barn, they are met with radio silence.

#TS: 26:44. Is about to go to the barn, because everyone wants her to. Throat is hurting and she's not feeling too great.

#TS: 26:59. Sun is setting while she is approaching the barn. Keeps hearing barking, but that is not that unusual around here because there's a lot of dogs in the area and they do have neighbours. Sunny is getting very bad vibes at the barn. Decides to take a break and go somewhere else first. 

#TS:47:56
Look around the [[Barn]]. There is a bunch of materials, cinder blocks, a hose etc. Most notable is a [[Lantern]] with a note under it. Sunny says it is a note definitely from the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]]. It says had to go, sorry Sunny. On the back it says be bakc (spelled that way instead of back). It is not the message that Sunny wanted to get but it definitely explains it. It is written in red crayon and with the spelling mistakes it makes it from the stranger.

#TS:1:01:32
Approaches her next stop, the [[FTD-Git/Locations/Gazebo]]. Stops near the [[Bridge]] to go towards it. Mentions that it is getting dark and that she brought her flashlight. She says the [[Bridge]] looks like it is about to fall apart. As she is walking on the bridge, there is a distant voice, maybe calling Sunny. Sunny says she thinks it was coming from the [[Barn]] and says there is no way in hell she is going there.


#TS:1:10:29
We see a glitchy video with a framed painting of a farm. There is a kid on a tractor and a red barn in the background. There seems to be a black dog in the additional carriage.

#TS:1:17:15
Another multiple whistles, near a barn. More glitching. The [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] is again standing near the trees.

#TS:1:18:16
Is approaching the [[Barn]] by golf cart. Sees a light coming from it. There is some glitching. Says it's the [[Lantern]]. More glitching. The [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] is standing there with the lantern. It's eyse are still white. It is trying to speak but only creepy distorted sounds come out.  Sunny speeds away. The second Sunny started getting home, the light on the golf cart turned off.  Finds flashlight, and when she points it, she points it directly at the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] with white eyes. She runs away.

#TS:1:35:42
Where should I go? Barn or Dock ^sidt-18
One last location tonight. most said the [[Barn]].
More glitching, and another bloody piece of paper, [[Bloody Barn 1]], with a dog torn off. Sunny says it looks fresh. Another whistle, and Sunny sees the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] in the distance. She grabbed the [[Lantern]] and the pieces of paper and went home.  

[[Bloody Barn 1]] was found there. Also the note with Had to go, sorry sunny
Be bakc.




Most of the barns on this land were built by [[Sunny's Grandpa - Marvin]] and his buddies, presumably [[John]] and [[Michael]].

When asked about the dangerous places for Sunny, Barn was one of the ones the stranger responded with a cow emoji.

When Sunny was in the Elsewhere, the stranger got asked where it was, and it responded Barn.

The fairy rings of mushrooms Sunny found were right beside the Barn.

The barn was presumably built around 2005-2006
