Walking home, Sunny explains that before disappearing, the [[The Stranger|The Stranger]] explained that the [[Pet Cemetery]] belonged to 'the man in trailer'. Sunny points out the trailer, saying that it means that a man used to live there and she is not going to investigate there now because she is not in the mood to deal with whatever scary things are there. She doesn't know if someone is living in there right now.
