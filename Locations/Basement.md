Sunny is first seen going to the basement because she is thirsty but the fridge with the water in it is in the basement, which she describes as very scary.

She starts explaining about how creepy the basement is, while looking at a doll, and when she turns around to point something else out, the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] is there so she runs and locks herself in the downstairs bathroom. When she emerges, the door is closed so she believes it is gone, then a bell goes off, the screen distorts and the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] is peeking behind the doorpost.
"Who are you" "I am what they have (not) / (lost)"
"Who is they" "I am here and they have left"
"What are you" "A warning"
"Who is here" #TS 13:42 #morse {Answer}.

The stranger sends her to the basement after getting her attention the next day. Sunny is too much of a coward but after an hour, she goes to the basement. The lights go off in the hallway, and when they turn the corner we see the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] turning off the lights for the main room of the [[Basement]]. Once Sunny enters the Basement, the Stranger is gone. Sunny turns around, mentions a photo that always creeps her out #TS 17:15, turns back around while turning on the lights and the Stranger is sitting in the chair.
Sunny says "Hi, where am I looking". The Stranger has a staring contest with Sunny and then simply replies: "Yes :)"
