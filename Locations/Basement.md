Sunny is first seen going to the basement because she is thirsty but the fridge with the water in it is in the basement, which she describes as very scary.

She starts explaining about how creepy the basement is, while looking at a doll, and when she turns around to point something else out, the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] is there so she runs and locks herself in the downstairs bathroom. When she emerges, the door is closed so she believes it is gone, then a bell goes off, the screen distorts and the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] is peeking behind the doorpost.
"Who are you" "I am what they have (not) / (lost)"
"Who is they" "I am here and they have left"
"What are you" "A warning"
"Who is here" #TS 13:42 #morse {Answer}.

The stranger sends her to the basement after getting her attention the next day. Sunny is too much of a coward but after an hour, she goes to the basement. The lights go off in the hallway, and when they turn the corner we see the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] turning off the lights for the main room of the [[Basement]]. Once Sunny enters the Basement, the Stranger is gone. Sunny turns around, mentions a photo that always creeps her out #TS 17:15, turns back around while turning on the lights and the Stranger is sitting in the chair.
Sunny says "Hi, where am I looking". The Stranger has a staring contest with Sunny and then simply replies: "Yes :)"

Episode 2 starts with a search in the basement. When [[Sunny]] asks the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] what she is looking for. The stranger responds with "You'll know"
#TS: 18:02 There is a paper in a white miniature house/church thing. Sunny shows it to the stranger and asks whether this is it, the stranger replies to "keep looking, there's more". 
#TS: 18:20 #morse `... --- .--. .... .. .` : Translation = Sophie. Sunny asks if it is the same morse code as before (end of episode 1), and the stranger responds with yeah. It has moved from the chair to the doorway.

Pretty flowers ->:\[ or The bell for sure ^bsc-2
#TS: 19:16 Sunny finds a paper under what seems like a praying golden angel. 
#TS: 19:20 Majority says flowers. They are red and white fake flowers with lights in them, but do not contain a paper.
Sunny asks the stranger if the three papers found are it, but the stranger replies No, from a different doorway. 

Bell for sure or Search the ashes. ^bsc-3
#TS: 19:47. Majority said under the bell. There is a paper there. 
#TS: 19:58. She asks the question for where to look next, the ashes or the toy car, but as she is pointing out the car, you can already see the paper and she says that it is definitely in the car. 

Ashes kinda sus or Coffee grinder sus ^bsc-4
#TS: 20:07. While Sunny is asking where to look next, the stranger appears behind her and says 'There's twelve' two times.
#TS: 20:18. Majority voted ashes. Sunny removes protective covering and finds a paper in the ashes. 

Coffee grinder or Piano Bench ^bsc-5
#TS: 20:34. Majority vote said Piano Bench. It is filled with a bunch of stuff, amongst which a paper. It also has a note. {Check what it says and whether it is part of the ARG or not}
#TS: 20:49. Goes to show the new choices, but spots one in the frame of a painting. 
#TS: 20:55. Again, goes to show off choices but spots one next to the coffee grinder and some sort of home sound system, a picture of someone in a white dress and some sort of ash tray with in it a pack of matches, some coins and the paper.
#TS: 20:58. Looks up at the coffee grinder and sees a paper sticking out of it.

Goes to search some more, nothing between the pillows or in the red glass ornament on the piano. #TS: 21:16. Goes to say she pretty much looked everywhere but then spots one hanging in the bell with an anchor behind it. 

Kettle or Piano ^bsc-6
#TS: 21:28. Majority voted Kettle. Contains a pair of cards (4 of hearts and 7 of hearts), a shell, and a coupon but no paper. Goes to check the piano and finds it along with a #TS: 21:44 google docs link written by a child in red crayon. The stranger is no longer in the room. Sunny calls out 
to it whether she can ask it about it, but no response.
