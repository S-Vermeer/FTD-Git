The bridge that crosses the [[Lake]] and connects the land to the [[FTD-Git/Locations/Gazebo]].

#TS: 28:26. Sees a [[Backpack]] on the bridge. Mentions that it was not here the other day. Takes it with her.

#TS:1:01:32
Approaches her next stop, the [[FTD-Git/Locations/Gazebo]]. Stops near the [[Bridge]] to go towards it. Mentions that it is getting dark and that she brought her flashlight. She says the [[Bridge]] looks like it is about to fall apart. As she is walking on the bridge, there is a distant voice, maybe calling Sunny. Sunny says she thinks it was coming from the [[Barn]] and says there is no way in hell she is going there.

#TS:1:16:17
Sunny is standing near the [[Bridge]]. Says that she  keeps hearing this whistling noise coming from the woods. There is some weird glitching happening. We hear the whistle, and it's the same one the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] made when distracting the mailman to steal the bag.
The [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] is standing on the other side of the [[Lake]]. The Lantern appears at Sunny's feet. When she looks back up, the stranger is gone.

When Sunny was in the elsewhere she saw [[Marcy Todd]] and [[Sophie Perry]] on the bridge, laughing and talking, but they couldn't hear or see them. The bridge looked pristine, like it was just built.

The bridge itself was most likely build around 2005-2006

The notes that were found in the [[Backpack]] on the Bridge were [[Backpack Marcy Todd 1]] and [[Backpack Marcy Todd 2]]

The stranger didn't talk to Marcy, but it did watch Marcy went onto the Bridge.
The stranger appeared to be walking towards the bridge before the [[Mist]] obscured it, and then they walked out with Sunny in its arms.
