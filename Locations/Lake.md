The lake surrounds the [[Gazebo]] and is crossed by the [[Bridge]].
The lake was dug by hand by [[Sunny's Grandpa]]

#TS: 33:57, Sunny came outside and the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] is just standing there by the lake. Per suggestion of the discord to befriend the stranger, has brought a gift. It is a plushie with a horn (narwhal?) Stranger goes to eat the horn, but Sunny stops it. Stranger looks at it and says "Cow". Sunny says that it is not a cow, that's Phillip. Stranger goes to pat it, and says "Cow" again. Sunny laughs a little and says, yeah. Cow.
