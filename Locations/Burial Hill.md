Right next to the [[Pet Cemetery]]

The hill where Sunny saw the [[The Stranger|The Stranger]] burry her in the [[Elsewhere]]
The stranger said it was made up by [[Mother]], an imposter.

Then she shows us where she saw herself get buried, which is a few meters away, but there is a place where the dirt is dug up with a shovel standing up. There is also a rake. Creepy sounds in the back. 

[[Burial Hill 1]] note was found. A torn piece of paper with a tree on it. 

When discussing seeing the stranger burry her on the hill when talking to the [[Mother]], (referred to as the 'lady') Sunny had a setback. Presumably because it mentions Mother.

Sunny says that she knows what it did, that she saw it burying her on the hill.  More glitching. Sunny says that the crazy tree lady showed it to her. 


One of Sunny's conspiracy theories is
2. The stranger dug Sunny up after burying her to feed on her energy. And it buried her in the first place for some kind of ritual to prepare her to be fed upon and to bind her soul to the land so once it is done using her for energy, it will be stuck there forever like all of the other souls that are trapped on this land. Though she believes it's a little more complicated than that.
