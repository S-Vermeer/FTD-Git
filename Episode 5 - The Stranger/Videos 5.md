#TS:1:10:29
We see a glitchy video with a framed painting of a farm. There is a kid on a tractor and a red barn in the background. There seems to be a black dog in the additional carriage.

#TS:1:10:37
The still glitchy screen shows a room with clothing, a tiled floor and some more stuff. It is pretty dark. 

#TS:1:10:48.
Phillip the stuffed animal is laying on a bed in a glitchy video. 

#TS:1:10:55
 We see a person walking down a road from behind some leaves, almost like someone is spying. They put down their bag. They pull out what appears to be a letter and put it in the mailbox. Behind the camera there is a whistle. The person looks around and goes to investigate, leaving their bag. The camera walks towards the bag and takes it before going back to their original position. We see the person returning and seeing that their bag is missing. They call out. At #TS 1:11:46 the screen glitches and we are in a new location behind a different type of tree. Again at #TS:1:11:55.  and at #TS:1:12:00. They seem to be approaching the [[Trailer]]. At #TS:1:12:05 there is another glitch, we are still near the trailer but it is darker. The person is gone, and a [[Mist]] is rolling in. There is a bunch of frequent glitching between locations filled with mist. At #TS:1:12:31 we see what appears to be the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] walking into the mist towards the [[Bridge]] before the [[Mist]] obscures them. Then we see the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] carrying Sunny out of the mist.

#TS:1:13:04
We see the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] laying against a tree with Sunny in its lap petting their hair. Then at #TS:1:13:18 we see the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] in a room with a bed with someone laying in the bed and putting down something on the nightstand table. After a glitch we see it putting Phillip on the bed too and standing there watching. Before looking at the camera. It's eyes are white. Some sound comes and it disappears. 

#TS:1:14:07
Sunny is back. Said she took her time this morning to take a nice shower, get some nice food. Drink a lot of water. Is hesitant to say something because she isn't sure how we are going to take it. Then she says 'We can't trust the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]]'. Says there are a lot of reasons why that she will go into, but that she saw some things and heard some things and found some things and that's why we can't trust it.

#TS:1:15:05
There is some weird glitching happening. Sunny says she has some notes, some explanations but also wants to say that she did watch through the previous videos that she is assuming the stranger made when the stranger had her phone and also read through the discord conversations from that time when the stranger was talking to us. Says it changes nothing about how she feels. 
Reasons:
1. If the stranger can cross between worlds, why didn't it just come and get me?
   Sunny is convinced it absolutely could have, since we have seen it appearing and disappearing.
2. If the stranger can go into the mist without being affected (which we've seen that it can) why didn't it go into the mist to save me immediately when it came back?
3. How is it possible that the stranger just happened to come back from being 'trapped' at the exact same time that I went missing?
Sunny says that it all doesn't really make sense to her, that it seems way too convenient.

#TS:1:16:17
Sunny is standing near the [[Bridge]]. Says that she  keeps hearing this whistling noise coming from the woods. There is some weird glitching happening. We hear the whistle, and it's the same one the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] made when distracting the mailman to steal the bag.
The [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] is standing on the other side of the [[Lake]]. The Lantern appears at Sunny's feet. When she looks back up, the stranger is gone.

#TS:1:16:38
There is some weird glitching happening. The [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] is just standing near the trees. When Sunny goes down to look, it is no longer there. 

#TS:1:17:15
Another multiple whistles, near a barn. More glitching. The [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] is again standing near the trees.

#TS: 1:17:37
Sunny says she got the golf cart because she didn't feel comfortable just being on foot while it's getting dark outside. She keeps hearing the whistle. Says she is going to try to hear it out. Brought pepper spray. Says she doesn't know if pepper spray works on supernatural inhuman beings. Doesn't think it can get any worse than how it's gotten.

#TS:1:18:16
Is approaching the [[Barn]] by golf cart. Sees a light coming from it. There is some glitching. Says it's the lantern. More glitching. The [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] is standing there with the lantern. It's eyse are still white. It is trying to speak but only creepy distorted sounds come out.  Sunny speeds away. The second Sunny started getting home, the light on the golf cart turned off.  Finds flashlight, and when she points it, she points it directly at the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] with white eyes. She runs away.

#TS:1:19:32
Sunny is seen with tear streaks. Saying she is scared. A lot of people have been telling her the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] is still trustworthy but she promises us it is not. A glitch happens. She says that the Stranger buried her, that she saw it happening in the [[Elsewhere]]. It was one of the many visions she had, and she says that we have to believe her or she is going to have to do this alone. 

#TS:1:20:10
Mania starts. Apologizes for the last post, says she is doing much better now because she has aligned all her thoughts and is ready to make theories. Says she needs to get herself together and just solve this mystery.
Says her brain is working and she has some ideas for us to hear. 
1. The stranger was manipulating all of us and her, it did and said things to lure us into a false sense of security so that when she came back and said anything negative, we would try to convince her that it is not true and would try to defend it. 
2. The stranger dug Sunny up after burying her to feed on her energy. And it buried her in the first place for some kind of ritual to prepare her to be fed upon and to bind her soul to the land so once it is done using her for energy, it will be stuck there forever like all of the other souls that are trapped on this land. Though she believes it's a little more complicated than that. 
3. The stranger is the mist. Because it has the same effect as the mist of feeling secure and safe. It is not the exact same feeling, but it's the same concept of a scary looking thing that on the outside repels you but once you are there you love it.
4. Sophie and Marcy are undercover investigating the incidents that happened on the land. For example, they might be part of some paranormal department in the CIA. They were clearly speaking in code to each other, which originally seemed to be because they were in love in a homophobic town but now she is doubting that.

Says that she knows it sounds ridiculous, but that the fact that she is connecting these dots despite how it sounds means that she literally can't be wrong. How would she make these connections if it wasn't right.

5. Everything is energy, and it can be consumed and released but not created or destroyed. All of the supernatural entities on this land are attracting the energy so that they can feed on it. Every soul is energy, but souls aren't actually real because there is something else instead of the soul that is real. It feels like a soul but it is not. 
6. The well is actually an entrance to an underground bunker where the two Johns from They might be giants are living and all of their song inspiration comes from what is going on here while they are being held captive there by somebody and is forcing them to write these songs so they can release them so that Sunny can hear them so that she can solve the mystery. Or maybe they don't want that, which is why they are keeping the Johns in the bunker
7. Thinks it has to do more with mirrors than we thought.  Thinks that right now she is the mirror, and on the other side of the mirror is actual life going on but she is in the mirror universe so that is why everything is so messed up and weird. where the souls that are not souls reside. That that is what she is. But when she looks into a mirror, that is the normal side she is supposed to be on. 
8. Her grandfather created the stranger and the weird woman thing Sunny talked to in the elsewhere in a lab. That is why she isn't allowed to go in the basement, because that is where the lab used to be. There is also black mould, but they probably put that there on purpose

Believes she can solve it on her own. 

#TS: 1:25:06
Mania end.
What are your theories on what is going on? ^ocb-8
Playing with cats while it is thundering outside.

#TS:1:25:24
Someone said that the believe the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] is hiding something, but not to discredit it completely. Sunny thinks that what the stranger is hiding is the fact that it definitely wants Sunny gone, but not until it has had everything it wants from her. It still has uses for Sunny, so that is why she is still alive. 

#TS:1:25:41
Some glitching. Someone said that it feels like the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] is still trying to help and that it seemed worried about her when she went missing. Sunny thinks it being worried was a lie that it told to earn all of our trust. She hopes it is true, but can't unsee the burying thing.

#TS:1:26:00
Sees the [[Mist]]. Says that's the thing that took her.
Someone suggested summoning the stranger to talk to explain itself. There is a whistle and a glitch and when she turns around, the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] is standing there with the lantern turned on. Sunny says she wants to talk. The stranger's eyes are still white. The stranger doesn't respond. Sunny says that she knows what it did, that she saw it burying her on the hill.  More glitching. Sunny says that the crazy tree lady showed it to her. Sunny questions why its eyes are white and asks where [[Grimm]] is. Says that when it went missing, so did grimm. More glitching, and the Stranger keeps covering it's mouth. Sunny says she needs to know what happened to Grimm, whether it knows.

#TS:1:27:21
#morse  starts.
Sunny questions if it can nod or shake its head, whether it can say something or give a motion with its head. More glitching. More #morse. Sunny says that if it refuses to explain itself than she has no choice but to not trust it.  That she wanted to. It puts the lantern down, the glitching stops, and it disappears.

#TS:1:28:03
Sunny says that last night was stressful, just like the last few weeks have been incredibly stressful and scary. That is why they don't want to focus too much on the stranger today, but wants to do a classic adventure like old times for some sense of normalcy to try to get back to the old routine and maybe look for [[Grimm]] today. 

#TS:1:28:44
Where should I go? Left (Trailer, Pet Cemetery) or Right (Well, Lake, Barn, Woods) ^sidt-15

#TS:1:28:58
Someone asked when she got buried. When she went missing, she went to what a lot of people are calling the [[Elsewhere]]. She says it's a really good word to describe it because it is really not here, but it is. While she was there, she kept hearing and seeing what she is calling echoes from the past. The land was different, the layout was different. [[Grandma's house]] wasn't even there at one point, just a big pit that was dug out. While she was there, towards the end before she woke up in her bed, she remembers receiving information from someone. However she keeps getting set backs, where her memory glitches out when she tries to think about certain things. Talking and thinking about certain things sets them back. But they do remember seeing the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] burying them where the [[Pet Cemetery]] is. It was very scary, and Sunny remembers having a lot of questions and thinking a lot of new things about... She receiving explanations, but she doesn't exactly remember what they are. She just remembers waking up in her bed and being very mistrusting and scared of the stranger. A deep in her heart fear that was not there before. Sunny realizes that her brain is not quite reliable right now. 

#TS:1:30:50
Someone sent a screenshot of their theory, that the stranger is different from what it used to be and that there is something bigger and more powerful at work. 
Towards the end, Sunny keeps getting set backs, where she will read it but have no idea what it said. She remembers reading it but not the words. There is a glitch. She can't figure out if the bigger things at play that this theory is referring to is a force of good that is trying to protect her from the stranger or completely the opposite. More glitching. When she woke up she had a very strong gut feeling that she was being protected from the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]]. But every time she thinks too hard about it, she gets set back again. 

#TS:1:31:47
Most chose Left with the Trailer and the Pet cemetery.
Which location? Trailer or Pet Cemetery ^sidt-16
Majority voted for [[Pet Cemetery]]. More glitching
This is also where Sunny saw the stranger burying her in the [[Elsewhere]]. More glitching. Somebody asked Sunny to count the amount of headstones in the pet cemetery. You can barely see the names on the stones, but they were pets from both [[Sunny's Grandma]]'s family and other people's pets from the neighborhood, which has maybe 3 neighbors. Sunny counts 13 total headstones. 

#TS:1:32:47
Then she shows us where she saw herself get buried, which is a few meters away, but there is a place where the dirt is dug up with a shovel standing up. There is also a rake. Creepy sounds in the back. 
She finds a note in the dirt. [[Burial Hill 1]]

#TS:1:34:02
Which way? Trailer or Other locations ^sidt-17
Most voted for trailer. More glitching. Last time she was here there was whispering and calling her name. She sees the lantern with a piece of bloody paper beneath it with dogs on it. Sunny doesn't like the implication of the blood so she decides to look for clues somewhere else. 

#TS:1:35:28
[[Bridge]] where Sunny saw [[Sophie Perry]] and [[Marcy Todd]] in the [[Elsewhere]]. They were sitting on the bridge together and it looked pristine, like it was just built.

#TS:1:35:42
Where should I go? Barn or Dock ^sidt-18
One last location tonight. most said the [[Barn]].
More glitching, and another bloody piece of paper, [[Bloody Barn 1]], with a dog torn off. Sunny says it looks fresh. Another whistle, and Sunny sees the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] in the distance. She grabbed the lantern and the pieces of paper and went home.  

#TS:1:37:46
Sunny mentions how people from the discord (its me :) ) suggested to look inside the battery compartment of the lantern. There is another bit of paper in there, a tree with some of the symbols from the past stuff. [[Lantern battery 1]]

#TS:1:39:09
More glitching. Sunny heard knocking, banging on the door. There is another bloody piece of paper next to the rest. It is covered in blood, more than the rest. The [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] appears with white eyes and blood coming from presumably its mouth. It falls over and disappears again. 
Music starts playing, Sunny says I don't want to do this anymore and to be continued shows on the screen, along with one of the symbols from the paper pieces in front of presumably the [[Trinity Church]]. The music is you belong to me, an instrumental version.  More glitching is happening during all this. A tree starts appearing more clearly while the symbol disappears.
