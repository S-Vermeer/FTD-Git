#TS: 35:24. Sunny sees the [[Trailer]]. Sees a lot of kitchenware. There is a shed to the left and 'whatever that is' (weird cage thing) to the right.

What should I check out first ? Shed or Weird Cage thing ^sidt-9
#TS: 36:00. Vote said cage. She is worried about the spiderwebs. 
#TS: 36:10. Hole in trailer with Champion under it. Also worried about poison ivy.
#TS: 36:24. Sees something that looks like a toolbox. Or not. It is a cage. Is not comfortable getting closer to the cage.
#TS: 36:46. Goes to check out the shed. Blocked by lumber (bunch of branches on the ground.) Is not comfortable opening the shed, but sees some chairs, some gasoline tanks. 'that's pretty suspicious.'

What should I look at? ^ocb-6
#TS:37:13. Doesn't see anything under the crawl space, but it looks like it has definitely collapsed. 

#TS: 37:28. Due to question finds four pieces of paper on crawl space. [[Crawl space Trailer 1]], [[Crawl space Trailer 2]], [[Crawl space Trailer 3]], [[Crawl space Trailer 4]].
#TS: 37:38. Goes to investigate the hole. Didn't see anything but got nervous. 
#TS: 38:07. Tries to go inside the trailer. Hears a scream. [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] calls out to Sunny. Says they gotta go. Sunny runs toward them.
 #TS: 38:20. Sunny asks the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] where it wants them to got. It says the [[Pet Cemetery]]. Asks the stranger what they need. Points to a note in the grass. [[Note Pet Cemetery 1]]. Asks if they can go home now. Stranger says no. 
 
#TS: 38:42. Asks [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] where they need to go now. Says [[Neighbours house red roof]]. When they arrive there, the stranger is gone from the cart. Phillip remains. The stranger is standing on the edge of the plot, holding the paper. [[Neighbours house red roof 1]]. Doesn't want to get back in, but takes phillip and Sunny leaves to go home.  

#TS: 39:40. It is dark. Sunny calls out to the stranger, saying they have soup for them. [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] appears. Asks if they really do. Sunny gives the stranger chicken soup. Warns that it is hot. Sunny asks if it is good and the stranger nods. Sunny asks if it likes it and the stranger gives another small nod. This makes Sunny conclude that the stranger is nice. Sunny pets their head and the stranger smiles. 

#TS:40:38. Sunny says it has been a while but decided to start filming videos again after their break because things have been happening even after they left their grandmas house. She went home but is being sent some creepy videos and needs to show us the notes they found on their last day there. 

Reads out [[Crawl space Trailer 1]]. Mentions that [[Sunny's Grandpa|Marvin]] is her grandfather. Reads out [[Crawl space Trailer 2]]. Reads out [[Crawl space Trailer 3]]. Reads out [[Crawl space Trailer 4]]. Reads out [[Note Pet Cemetery 1]].  Reads out [[Neighbours house red roof 1]].

#TS:43:05. What Sunny's gathered from that is that [[Sophie Perry]] is not the only person who has gone missing. It looks like [[John]] has gone missing as well. She isn't sure about [[Marcy Todd]] but she needs to find out if she is still around so she can talk to her and ask whether Sophie knew John. 

#TS: 43:26. Unrelated to the mystery, Sunny asks if people have seen Ghostbusters Afterlife because they love it. They used to love ghostbusters as a kid. Plays with their silly little shoes and silly little socks because they are bored. Wants to go back to [[Grandma's house]]. Also misses [[Grimm]].
