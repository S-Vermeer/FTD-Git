Look around the [[Barn]]. There is a bunch of materials, cinder blocks, a hose etc. Most notable is a [[Lantern]] with a note under it. Sunny says it is a note definitely from the [[The Stranger|The Stranger]]. It says had to go, sorry Sunny. On the back it says be bakc (spelled that way instead of back). It is not the message that Sunny wanted to get but it definitely explains it. It is written in red crayon and with the spelling mistakes it makes it from the stranger.

Should I take the Lantern? ***Yes*** or No ^sidt-11


#TS:1:08:21
Sees a red light in the distance. It is getting really [[Mist]]y out here. It feels nice. She goes over to look at the light. It is so pretty. Leaves her phone and walks with the [[Lantern]] towards the light. A creepy voice calls to Sunny, repeating her name. Sometimes the S is elongated like a snake. Says 'come on Sunny, just come into the [[Mist]]' and then laughs.

#TS:1:16:17
Sunny is standing near the [[Bridge]]. Says that she  keeps hearing this whistling noise coming from the woods. There is some weird glitching happening. We hear the whistle, and it's the same one the [[The Stranger|The Stranger]] made when distracting the mailman to steal the bag.
The [[The Stranger|The Stranger]] is standing on the other side of the [[Lake]]. The [[Lantern]] appears at Sunny's feet. When she looks back up, the stranger is gone.

#TS:1:18:16
Is approaching the [[Barn]] by golf cart. Sees a light coming from it. There is some glitching. Says it's the lantern. More glitching. The [[The Stranger|The Stranger]] is standing there with the [[Lantern]]. It's eyse are still white. It is trying to speak but only creepy distorted sounds come out.  Sunny speeds away. The second Sunny started getting home, the light on the golf cart turned off.  Finds flashlight, and when she points it, she points it directly at the [[The Stranger|The Stranger]] with white eyes. She runs away.

#TS:1:26:00
Sees the [[Mist]]. Says that's the thing that took her.
Someone suggested summoning the stranger to talk to explain itself. There is a whistle and a glitch and when she turns around, the [[The Stranger|The Stranger]] is standing there with the [[Lantern]] turned on. Sunny says she wants to talk. The stranger's eyes are still white. The stranger doesn't respond. Sunny says that she knows what it did, that she saw it burying her on the hill.  More glitching. Sunny says that the crazy tree lady showed it to her. Sunny questions why its eyes are white and asks where [[Grimm]] is. Says that when it went missing, so did grimm. More glitching, and the Stranger keeps covering it's mouth. Sunny says she needs to know what happened to Grimm, whether it knows.

#TS:1:27:21
#morse  starts.
Sunny questions if it can nod or shake its head, whether it can say something or give a motion with its head. More glitching. More #morse. Sunny says that if it refuses to explain itself than she has no choice but to not trust it.  That she wanted to. It puts the [[Lantern]] down, the glitching stops, and it disappears.

#TS:1:34:02
Which way? Trailer or Other locations ^sidt-17
Most voted for [[Trailer]]. More glitching. Last time she was here there was whispering and calling her name. She sees the [[Lantern]] with a piece of bloody paper beneath it with dogs on it. [[Bloody Trailer 1]] Sunny doesn't like the implication of the blood so she decides to look for clues somewhere else. 

#TS:1:35:42
Where should I go? Barn or Dock ^sidt-18
One last location tonight. most said the [[Barn]].
More glitching, and another bloody piece of paper, [[Bloody Barn 1]], with a dog torn off. Sunny says it looks fresh. Another whistle, and Sunny sees the [[The Stranger|The Stranger]] in the distance. She grabbed the [[Lantern]] and the pieces of paper and went home.  

#TS:1:37:46
Sunny mentions how people from the discord (its me :) ) suggested to look inside the battery compartment of the lantern. There is another bit of paper in there, a tree with some of the symbols from the past stuff. [[Lantern battery 1]]



I’m really confused and something changed once I had the lantern again
Not great at putting my feelings into words, sorry
*Sunny? Do you think the setbacks have to do with the lantern in some way?*
Once I got the lantern they started getting less intense
The set backs that is
I think the stranger was trying to fix whatever was happening to my brain

*Some of us think the paper in the lantern was some sort of protection sigil*
When I got the lantern I also wasn’t so scared of the stranger anymore
It’s this. [[Lantern battery 1]]
I feel like it’s making everything a bit clearer
Not completely but I feel more leveled now? Does that make sense
*We think the code says “Sunny safe”*
