At trailer:

Dear John I left cash for you under the front porch matt. Thanks for the help. I'll be at the house tomorrow at 10 to help finish up the basement. I'll see you then - Marvin

Dear John,
Thanks for coming early yesterday. I think we'll start on the well next week. I've already taken care ofo the pipes and heaters, so all you need to do is dig in the place I marked. I'll be out of town that whole week, so please watch over the house while I'm gone. Thx - Marvin

Dear John,
You are a fast worker! I came home and saw the finished well. I honestly thought the well would take at least 2 to 3 months. The cash is in the same place as last time. - Marvin

Dear John,
I haven't seen you in a while. Just checking up to make sure you're alright. You're always welcome at our house - Marvin

Pet Cemetery:

Dear Denise,
My wife and I welcome you to the neighborhood! I hope you enjoyed the pie Helen fixed up for you. We're always a hop skip and a jump away. Don't be a stranger! - Marvin


House with the red roof:
Dear Michael,
You remember John who lives in that trailer near my house? I haven't heard from him in a few weeks. If you see his car coming down the road, let me know. He never picked up his cash I left him from helping me build my well. It would be a shame if something bad happened to the poor guy. Please keep me updated. You're always welcome at our house - Marvin

Barn:
Had to go, sorry sunny

Gazebo
(Bridge, backpack marcy): 
Marcy Todd- Stay away from my daughter Sophie. I know exactly what you're trying to do and it won't work. Don't make me have to talk to you in person. You are skilled in the ways of the devil, and I won't have you influencing my daughter to give in to sin. I can tell by your piercings and your affect on Sophie that you're already condemned to hell with no saving.

Marcy Todd- It is your fault that Sophie is missing. If it hadn't been for you leaving her unattended, you could've seen who took her. I bet you were doing drugs somewhere with other rejects from God. I have yet to see you in church, begging God for forgiveness for what you alone have done. I hope you are happy.
