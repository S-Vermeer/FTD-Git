!Sunny gets asked about her jean jacket. 
All I know is that it belonged to my [[Sunny's Grandpa|Grandad]], and my [[Sunny's Grandma|Grandma]] gave it to me as a gift to remember him by.
So, yes! It is a hand-me-down

!Sunny gets asked whether she has mentioned the strange things to her grandma or whether her grandma has mentioned anything to her.

Great question! I’ve been trying not to stress her out, so I don’t say much. She’s also deaf and doesn’t know ASL, so I can usually only talk to her fluently when she has her cochlear implant in, but all I have mentioned is the dog. She told me that dog pays the house visits every now and again. She has told me ghost stories in the past, and it’s a popular theory in my family that the land is haunted, but nobody has said anything about a black dog or about anyone named Sophie.

!Ghost stories
Not that I can think of. There is this one ghost story my grandma told me when I was younger. Whenever my grandfather first built the house on this land, she was home alone and went outside to hang up some laundry on the clothes line when she heard a high pitched voice calling out the name “Rosie! Rosie!” She looked and looked and nobody was there.

Grandpa lake
He dug it forever ago. He built the house I’m staying in. He and his buddies all got together and dug the basement and built most of the barns on this land
I’m pretty sure the house started getting built in like 1999-2001 but he had been working on this land for ages before that

Sunny sends screenshot of instagram user36453628191 with a link to a video of a car driving and messages saying hi, hello, where did you go. The video is the same as the one posted on twitter.

Sunny was pulled deeper into the mist by not really a voice but an energy, and she felt her own conscience leave the further she went in. She felt like she was losing herself and the most close to herself she has ever been.

The car from the insta post
That model is a 1929 ford and that’s why the coloration is off because it’s 94 years old. Sunny said it's her grandfathers car, it's still in the garage and has been there for as long as she can remember, it is now overrun by spiderwebs

Sunny: Im terrified of bugs. Always have been. As I was walking out, I saw a few roaches and I freaked and almost didn’t even go out to adventure. When I was in the mist, I just wanted to lay down in the grass and look up at the stars. It’s not like I forgot about the bugs… I was just… suddenly completely fine with them. I would have been perfectly content to lay there forever, bugs and all.

*you are trapped because you got in trouble?* Cow
*Trapped again ? Or before?* Cow
*are you/were you physically trapped or is it more of a metaphysical limitation thing?* Cow
*were you unable to talk to sunny earlier because you were still trapped?* Cow

Guides ❌ little box fones

*guides cant mess with phones so this is safe* Cow

Not know
about box fone

*Or it doesn't count when they text here some strange technically because the beings are too ancient to know about phones* Cow

*well the ❌ apparently meant danger before so - are phones dangerous to the guides* Cow

*technology is dangerous to guides so it is safe for stranger* Cow

*can you use tech against the guides?* 
No
Just to keep secret

*So they can know what you are doing except on phones?* Cow

Cow was last rule then trap
guides want ballans
ball ants (balance)

*Okay so to recap- You are an omen of sorts that shows up when everyone is in danger. That's your job. But you broke the rules by interfering and talking to Sunny. So they punished you keeping you from appearing to Sunny all this time. Now Sunny is gone into the mist and you're going to need our help to save them. This is safe because the guides don't know anything about phones so they can't watch what you say in here.* Cow

*We haven’t seen the stranger since the cow*
*The cow was the tipping point right?* Cow

*so they dont like that you got attached and help a friend* Cow

*And since then you didn’t give Sunny any clues any more?*

It keeps showing up outside the house
I went home and I keep seeing it through the window
Appearing and disappearing
The stranger.
I understand why y’all think I might be jumping to conclusions, trust me. Trust me I do. It was really hard

*sunny, could you tell us more about what happened to you? because we’ve been trusting the strangers perspective all this time with nothing else to go on*
That’s what it wanted
It wanted your trust. All of your trust.

*does that mean all the things it said were lies?
about sophie? and the others?*
I think the stranger might be somewhat responsible

I’m so scared of it now. After being comforted by its presence for months.
*is it okay if we ask about where you went?*
It was like here but I just kept seeing echoes. That’s what she called them, echoes.
*hey! does using ur phone feel like strange at all? just bc ik it’s had it and how it messes with technology*
It feels normal, but almost every time I play back something I film, the video is glitching out. I think the stranger is messing with it.

*Do you mind if I ask what makes you think the Stranger could have gotten you sooner? It seemed like it couldn't just go there, it had to trick the mailman into looking for his bag to summon the mist? I don't know if I misunderstood that*
Wait that’s true
I have no idea what to think

*was anyone else in there with you?*
Lots of things. Most couldn’t see me

My memories are a little bit blurry. I’m scared they might be fading the longer I’m gone. Someone showed me the stranger trying to bury me. On the hill. I was going to make a video saying it but I kept getting too scared to.
It was an echo of something that already happened meaning the stranger did try to bury me at some point and then decided against it. It was my body. Like my soul had left it.
I appreciate that. My mind keeps churning trying to figure out why it would bury me and then dig me back up and let me live. I can’t make sense of it.
*Were there any other things that you saw? People such as Marcy or John?*
I saw Marcy and Sophie
They were on the bridge laughing and talking
They couldn’t hear or see me I was asking for help
*in one of the audios, we heard you say you can’t trust anyone. what about your family?*
They don’t believe me. My grandma and my aunt
I’m scared to show them
They aren’t here anyways im alone
They were gone. I was house sitting and they won’t be back for another month
*do you feel safe in the house alone?*
No. I don’t feel safe anywhere anymore and I feel like the stranger wants something from me
I guess I could go home but I’d be alone there too

*heya sunny, what did you mean by the lady you saw?*
YES okay so there was this thing
She was really tall and hard to see it was dark and I couldn’t make her out
But she was really tall
*Did she talk to you?*
She did
*Do you remember what she said?*
Not all of it if I’m completely honest. I just remember kind of spilling my guts to her.
I may have overshared to this random entity lady in the woods.
I remember she picked me up and held me though. When I was crying. At some point.
*Did you have a particular feeling talking to her? Like how the mist made you feel safe , or how the trailer was scary?*
Not really, i was actually suspicious and agitated at first. I remember she kept saying something over and over and I was getting angry because she didn’t understand
That’s when I kind of let it all out.

*is there any particular reason that you feel like sharing with us why your grandma is away? of course i get it if it is too personal*
She is going on a trip with her friend
She deserves a nice vacation, she just turned 80!! I’m happy to help
I just wish everything weren’t so scary

What if I tried chasing the stranger
What do y’all think would happen
At this point I’m kind of just playing around with fate
I always do the expected thing but what if I did the unexpected thing

Sunny is back in the channel

Hey Stranger! Where are you? Im looking for you
Can you come meet me at the barn please?
@the stranger haiiiii
I’m at the barn
All this time I waisted. I COULD HAVE BEEN TEXTING THE STRANGER? I wonder if I would have solved the mystery by now.
I think it’s kinda silly that the stranger stole someone’s phone. It probably had a good reason to.
I wanna know who’s phone it has. Maybe that’s why it knows some English!
*it could be sophie's...*
Hmmm when was the iPhone invented? (assuming it is an iPhone I mean it could be a Samsung)
*i mean do we even have a time period where sophie might've been not missing?*
*sophie went missing in 2006*

Talk to sunny only start (21/10/23)
https://discord.com/channels/909909069345726524/1165144856893599744/1165145370741968927
The stranger is here too
I’m scared why is it everywhere
Sorry I don’t mean to freak out
I made a channel that it isn’t in because I don’t want it to see too much about what I’m saying in case it is a danger to me

*hey sunny- have you listened back to the most recent videos yet? i think there’s some morse code in them*
Wait really?
Morse code?
I feel like it might be unable to speak.
Which is why this is happening
*I agree. Based on body language & it seemed to confirm that when I tried to ask in the other channel. I think the morse code may be communication from the stranger*
If y’all had seen what I saw you would be really mistrusting too I promise
I’m not crazy
*we’re hesitant to trust it too. but we also want to solve this mystery, and the stranger is trying to communicate something*
Good point
I just felt the need to clarify
I know I haven’t been the most communicative when I came back, I’m not great at talking with people and this has made it so much harder

https://discord.com/channels/909909069345726524/1165144856893599744/1165147015555076177
*You mentioned Sophie and marcy were talking in code? What did you mean by that?*
Well, everything sounded weird and out of place like the sounds were coming from different places every second but it was still making up words
*I know some of us have discussed that things could be distorted/mixed up/backwards in the other place. Could it be that they maybe weren't speaking in code, but you were possibly seeing a distorted version of the past?*
It was definitely from the past
Everything I saw was mostly from the past
*Like you said "echos"?*
That’s how she described them
*She?*
Everytime I say that something weird goes on in my brain
Like a memory thing and everytime I come to it it feels far away again
Something’s messing with my brain maybe
It’s like I can’t talk about it
*Maybe it's a side effect. It seems like every time you talk about this "tree lady" , things get a bit foggy?*
Yes
Even when reading that message it’s like something sets back in my brain
I remember it happening but I don’t remember the thought before it happens
*Do you remember anything you can definitely tell us?*
Marcy and Sophie on the bridge talking 
Car and music and digging 
I remember saying a lot of deeply personal things to 
God it keeps happening
The last part
The repeat the set back
*to the woman?*
I remember seeing a very vivid image of the stranger with my lifeless body and I watched it bury me and everything else I saw that entire time was echoes I even saw my grandad
It was so many events on the land
People talking, things getting built
*Did you see the image of what happened on the hill when you were with the lady? Did she show it to you?* **Set back here**
It’s happening again. Can I just let y’all know when a certain question has triggered that set back?
So you know which questions are doing it?
Any videos you have, please send them
https://discord.com/channels/909909069345726524/1165144856893599744/1165152966597161000
*Here’s one of you (but unreversed)* 
Oh
That’s when I saw it (The stranger burying me)
*https://www.instagram.com/reel/CyM7TQ9ozWo/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA== and i believe you were crying in this one* 

*this one? https://discord.com/channels/909909069345726524/1165144856893599744/1165154545752604722*
I remember saying that
I said so much more than that
That was right before I saw it
*how long was that after youd gotten there?*
That was right toward the end
Before I woke up
In my bed
I was talking to her
It happened again
Set back
*what happened in the beginning?*
Marcy and Sophie
They couldn’t hear or see me
They were on the bridge talking and laughing
*If it was before you saw the stranger on the hill, what were you talking about in that video? You said "Do I know the person who did this" - did what?/not forced, understand if it's too much*
CW for potentially upsetting things 
I saw someone bury a large heavy bag it really seemed like someone might have been in there
*was it in the basement of your grandma’s house?*
I kept seeing things like that it was apparent someone has been doing this.
My grandmas house wasn’t even built yet it was still under construction
In that echo
There was a pit though
Like they were digging the basement
*oh, when was your grandmas house built?*
I’m not sure. I remember I was really little when I started visiting though
*About how little do you think?*
Four or five
*and youre 19 now?*
I am
Someone has been making people disappear
*2008-2009*
Then I saw the stranger doing the same thing and I immediately realized the fact that it was too dark to see who was burying the bag
*so… might it also have been too dark to see if it was stranger burying you?*
That was the only time I actually could see it for sure
It was the stranger. With the white eyes
I remember something happening after I saw that. I remember crying and then it felt like I was being held. I don’t know, the memory skips again every time I try to think too hard about it
*Sunny, every time your memory skips or resets - it is always related to that woman, the tall "tree lady". I think that's important*
I wish I could read your message without getting set back again Bex
Whatever you’re saying is probably right
Because it’s making it happen
I was lied to, something like that
Maybe it’s just the mist withdrawals

https://discord.com/channels/909909069345726524/1165144856893599744/1165161386268172299
THATS IT
Sorry I remember so vividly
The car, the music, all of it. Except this audio is missing the bag dragging
And the beginning where I’m crying in reverse I don’t think that belongs there
Maybe that’s how what’s going on there sounds when it’s being picked up from a recording device from here
I think the stranger has control over technology. Maybe it can use that power to pick up on frequencies we can’t hear
And it found my frequency from where I was
I spent a lot of time there I saw a lot of stuff play out but it looks like what y’all got were tid bits that are out of order
Though it got closer together near the end it seems
*sorry jumping back to what you had talked about earlier with marcy and sophie, did it seem like they were in the mist at all? or just a memory/echo of them?*
No mist while I was there
I actually didn’t remember going into the mist at all while I was there. Didn’t remember until I got back and watched through everything.
But now that I’m out it’s having a negative affect. I don’t want to go into it out of fear of freaking anyone out and i don’t want anyone to panic but it is hard to not try to go back in. I don’t need any convincing not to, it’s not that I want to. It’s hard to explain.

To be honest I’m kind of disturbed. It’s really hard to not take into account what I saw. Part of me wants so badly for it to be telling the truth but alarm bells keep going off and I keep feeling like it’s plotting all of this out to keep everyone but me on its side.
So that I can be extra alone, more than I already am. And that makes me an easier target.
*I think its interesting that your memory doesn't reset when talking about the stranger, only the other topic. I don't know what that means yet- hopefully you can read this message*
This message didn’t set me back
My brain immediately goes to my brain is protecting me from something
But then there’s the other thought which is something had some kind of an effect on my brain
And to be clear, reading the chat where the stranger was talking made me set back a bunch of times
I just didn’t know the rhyme or reason it just kept happening
But talking about it here isn’t causing it
This topic has to do with
Has to do with
I’m trying to say it I keep getting set back
Do you see? How I’m texting that’s literally how my brain is reading this stuff
It’s so frustrating
*You weren't alone in the other place, after going into the mist. At some point, you met her. A woman. You were agitated and restless at first- you didn't trust her. She kept repeating something, over and over again. You got angry- she didn't understand. But eventually- you broke down. You told her everything, you cried to her. She picked you up, held you. She was tall, this lady in the wood. She showed you things. She told you about the echos.*
⏮⏮⏮
Reading that is crazy, like my brain is TV static
WAIT
“It’s so easy to go home”
Sorry I got that, like a voice saying that
I think that’s what
That’s what
Gahhh it’s happening again
*What tone is it using? Comforting, or more discouraging?*
Sorry tone for what?
*"It's so easy to go home"*
⏮


https://discord.com/channels/909909069345726524/1165144856893599744/1165168883456540732
Other than the echos, were you alone there?
No
There were other… things?? I guess?? Anything I could recognize to be human couldn’t see or hear me
Thinking about that kinda gives me the skips though ⏮⏮
*are there any mushrooms growing around your grandmas house? or have you ever had fungi in the basement or something like that?*
I’m unfortunately not allowed in the actual basement basement due to the black mold growing there.
But I guess mold does count as fungi?? Am I wrong about that?
*what faces did you see that you can remember?*
Marcy and Sophie, my grandpa, myself as a child and my current self, and now I just keep skipping. I remember talking to things.
Wait I saw some guy helping my grandpa with construction
*sunny. this is very horrible. but do you think someone could have been buried in the actual basement years ago?*
It’s very possible.
*maybe that’s why there’s so much mold. a body… decaying.*
That’s sick
It would have to be under the basement though. The basement is floored and covered with cement on all sides
*John maybe?*
Oh Yeah the guy that helped with the well
I remember he and my grandpa seemed to get along super well
From what I saw in the elsewhere
*i mean if the rest of the house was built more recently than 2006. it makes sense. it could have been sealed off*
*those fairy rings you found, where are they again in relation to the rest of the land?*
They were right beside the barn
*Did you know anything else about him (john)?*
My memory of the elsewhere isn’t great but he was wearing overalls
Blue overalls
At least when I saw him talking to my grandpa
*Hey Sunny! Remember us telling you that there was some morse code in the stories where you tried to confront the stranger?*
*The Morse code translates to “grim me” and “sunny please” (I think)*
Oh
Sunny please what…
Please get in that grave?
Hm, “me grim”
I’m kind of freaked out by the notion that the stranger is grim because I really love grim. Like that means one of my only friends isn’t who I thought
Sorry I know it’s a dog

Someone else like me
Maybe it has a collection of phones from people it’s drained the energy from
And trapped on the land
*It gave yours back right?*
Yeah, it did actually
It was resting on my side table
Is something about the set backs a reason all of you are believing the stranger?
Something I am unable to comprehend?
*I think so
But it could’ve lied*
I feel like I’m missing something
Yes, I’m okay
I believe it now.
*believe what?*
About the stranger
Something’s not right
My brain feels so much clearer now
*do you still think it's untrustworthy?*
No, not anymore.
At least I’m more inclined to trust it.
My memory isn’t as weird anymore
I still have memory gaps and blocks
*Sunny, do you remember anything about the mother?*
Sorry, the mother?
*Follow up question, do you understand what I mean when I ask if you remember the mist?*
Yea of course
*Sunny do you not know who the mother is?*
Maybe that’s something that was skipping before?
*Do you remember the tall tree lady?*
Vaguely
*What’s the last thing you remember before waking up?*
From being in the elsewhere?
I remember seeing the stranger burying me after overhearing and then I remember getting picked up and held
I was confused but I just didn’t know what to do so I just let it happen
*Is there anymore to that memory?*
I remember getting told that the stranger could have come and gotten me if it wanted to
And I remember getting told the same thing over and over again
And I was getting agitated
It’s so easy to get home
The thing is, it wasn’t easy
If it weren’t for the stranger I would have been there for a really long time
*Could the stranger and grim be the same person?*
I think that’s what it’s trying to tell me
I’ve been looking at the characters closely
*Do you believe it?*
I think I do…
I definitely do
*What do you think about all of this-?*
I’m really confused and something changed once I had the lantern again
Not great at putting my feelings into words, sorry
*Sunny? Do you think the setbacks have to do with the lantern in some way?*
Once I got the lantern they started getting less intense
The set backs that is
I think the stranger was trying to fix whatever was happening to my brain
*Some of us think the paper in the lantern was some sort of protection sigil*
When I got the lantern I also wasn’t so scared of the stranger anymore
It’s this. [[Lantern battery 1]]
I feel like it’s making everything a bit clearer
Not completely but I feel more leveled now? Does that make sense
*We think the code says “Sunny safe”*
*What do you remember from the mist?*
- Marcy and Sophie on the bridge, laughing and talking.
- my grandpa and a man helping him with construction of the house
- me when I was little
- talking to different things in the woods but I don’t remember what they looked like or what we talked about
- car driving in with music, burying a bag
- weird tree lady (my brain is skipping every time I try to read this one back after I wrote it)
- over sharing
- receiving conflicting information
- seeing myself getting buried by the stranger
- being held and comforted

I don’t know how to explain it
It’s like fear wasn’t natural
Yes what I saw was scary, but the way in which I was scared just let up last night
*I think the fear of the stranger was artificial? Something wanting to separate you and the stranger?
The stranger said the mother didn’t want you two together for balance or something*
This is a lot

https://discord.com/channels/909909069345726524/1165144856893599744/1165706454074921020
I remember a small glowy animal
Like a ferret or something like it
It was talking to me though
In the elsewhere
*Could you understand it?*
Yes I could
It told me that it was so easy to get home
*To your home?*
Out of the elsewhere I’m assuming
Because that’s what I was asking
It was laughing a lot
And speaking in riddles it was severely weird. Weirder than usual.
I remember a name!!
Ludos.
*It is latin!
Comes from the root word Ludo which means game*
Maybe not riddles, just definitely being really vague about stuff
Like if I asked a question it would be something like “do clocks tell the time?” It was kind of irritating at times
“What animal keeps the best time?”
That’s the riddle
I remember now
*Isn’t the answer a ‘watch’dog*
Yes, I said that and then it said “and what good is a watchdog if it can’t watch” or something like that
Then I asked if it knew where Grim was
Then it started laughing
Before that we had a conversation about the stranger so maybe it thought it was funny because I didn’t know at the time?
I asked about the stranger and it just said “none are strangers to me” like okay you have friends that’s great
“My omen” I remember hearing that five separate times in different conversations
*the stranger told us about the mother. who’s somewhat in control of what it is allowed to do*
Oh my god… is that why it can’t speak or assist without getting injured?
I feel horrible.
It had to do all of that just to get me the lantern
Yes actually I remember someone saying something to me
Something about helping with seeing
I don’t remember who said it
I think they help with seeing? I’m sorry I don’t really know what it means I just have a faint memory
They have some kind of purpose that has something to do with vision

https://discord.com/channels/909909069345726524/1165144856893599744/1165812136627413072
*Did you know anything about a Michael? He was mentioned in a few of your grandpas letters, but we didn’t really know anything about him*
Yeah he used to live in the house with the red roof, a neighbor of my grandparents
I actually have no idea if he still lives there or not
*Did you ever hear anything else about him or is that it?*
I think I may have swam in their pool when I was a kid
Yeah I definitely did
I don’t remember Michael much but his wife, Jackie, was always so nice to me
*do you know denise?*
No
That was a new name to me
*Does Jackie still live there do you think?*
I’m not sure. If she does, then Michael probably does too.
*do you know how many neighbours you have? is it quite a remote place, just a few houses and the trailer*
There are three other houses
But they are all super spaced out
*do you know who lived in them?*
Well, a few distant cousins
But the red roof house has always been Jackie and Michael’s we just either haven’t talked to or about them in a long time or they moved
*I doubt the Stranger has a council or something to answer to for giving magical artifacts to non-magical beings*
I don’t know… it said a lot about rules and stuff. I’m still so confused about seeing it bury me and now it’s doing everything it can to help me, even if it hurts itself in the process. Why me?
*do you remember the sorts of rules these were? like, the vibes, general rundown or idea*
It was while I was gone. I read through it in #⁠talk-to-the-stranger-now-apparently while it had my phone. I don’t remember a whole lot of it
I did but at the time I was getting the weird brain skips. Every time I doubted that the stranger couldn’t be trusted, my brain skipped and I was filled with fear again. It doesn’t do that nearly as much anymore. I still get scared uncontrollably though, like there is still remnants of whatever was affecting my brain in the first few days home from the elsewhere
*Does (the necklace) make you feel a specific way when you look at it?*
Nope
It looks old though, lots of discoloration
Not really, it’s just fading silver
When I walked in and saw the stranger, it looked really startled like it didn’t expect me to be there. Like I was somewhere I really wasn’t supposed to be. It felt like I walked in on/interrupted something.
Also, the hole. It was really deep and it had a tree growing in it. Again, I have never ever seen it before. There was moss all over the sides.

https://discord.com/channels/909909069345726524/1165144856893599744/1179242195065253928
Listening very intensely
I’m so confused those words don’t make sense it’s like they are out of order
Why is she talking backwards in the first place. The video looks like it’s playing forwards.
You can see the raindrops and everything in the original
I am home now, so no can do at the moment, but also, it’s kind of strange it’s phone hasn’t died before
I mean think about it. My grandma has hardly any neighbors and the houses are old so there aren’t any outdoor plugs it could just plug a phone into. Also, where would it have gotten a charger? I have so many questions. I do know one thing and it’s that the stranger and technology have some kind of thingy. All of my devices go wonky when it is around
One time when I was pulling out my phone to record the stranger, it started recording all on its own without me even touching it.
Probably meant nothing tho! Tech is weird like that :p
Oh yeah and that video, by the way, that is trail cam footage. Forgot to tell y’all that! My bad!
There are trail cams planted on the property
I’m pretty sure they haven’t been functional for years, my grandma installed them years ago and they stopped working. So weird!
*Maybe that's old footage?*
It was dated from a few days ago, but idk!
*Maybe the stranger was able to make them work in the elsewhere*
That would explain the glitching when it’s around
*hey sunny, did you spot the suitcase in the back of the car in the video you posted? there also might have been a piece of paper at the front of the car, when you go back to the house you should definetely check it out, it might be a clue as to where the stranger is!*
That’s a good idea! I’ll take some notes
I saw that suitcase, yeah!
*maybe the stranger itself doesn't have access to technology, but can infiltrate such things itself.*
It said it used to have a phone. Maybe something took it’s phone away after it sent the video? I’m just guessing
I’m remembering things from the elsewhere
Guides
“My omen”
There were four of them
They kept having moments where it was like someone else was talking through them
Four guides
They all acted and looked different but I remember one was a small ferret like animal and it spoke in riddles and laughed a lot
It was glowing white
And it said “my omen” under its breath all deadpan and wistful all of a sudden
I think something was affecting my memory back then and now my brain feels a lot clearer ever since I put the necklace on
Watching the old videos back… that definitely wasn’t my usual self
*You said there were four guides/omens, what were the others besides the ferret and the stranger?*
One only cried
For the most part
*Was one Grim?*
no, no
I still haven’t seen Grim since 2021 I wonder if the stranger lost access to that form somehow
I’m only just now remembering things about the mother. It used to give me the skips really bad. (The skips are this thing that started happening to me after the stranger pulled me out of the mist/elsewhere as y’all are calling it! Basically any time I read or thought or heard about certain subjects pertaining to certain things I saw, heard, or felt in the elsewhere, my brain would just erase that specific word or knowledge from my head. I would know that I had read it though. It’s like the words were just out of reach. Sorry if that makes absolutely no sense! )
It’s like when you know a word but for some reason it just won’t come to you when you need to use it.

*Hey sunny, can you explain a bit more about the house that got broken down where the mailbox is now? Like when did it get broken down, did your grandma used to live there etc? Because the current house got built just before you were born I believe but the old house I have no clue about![🤔](https://discord.com/assets/d5d18f9c17a19de2.svg)*
Great question! So my grandfather’s parents had a house there that I think had been there and renovated from as far back as the 1800’s (I could be wrong, I can fact check that with my grandmother later) Anyways, my grandfather grew up there, and then they moved somewhere else, my grandfather got married, and the house got bulldozed and torn down. The mailbox stayed though for some reason! They probably just forgot to take it down. Or maybe it was then used for the trailer? Who knows. Anyways years later, my grandfather (Marvin) re-visited the land that he grew up on and decided he really wanted to build a farm house there for his family. He was a farmer as well as a car engineer. For Ford I believe? I could be wrong, he was kind of a mysterious guy. Anyways, I believe he started mapping out/drawing blueprints for the new house around 1999 and that lasted until about 2001 when he just started clearing and landscaping the land while he was saving up money and materials for the construction. I think he started actually building around 2005-2006 and this includes all of the barns and the lake / gazebo / bridge /dock
*And is there like a point people started to feel like it was haunted? With the new house or the old one too?*
That is also a good question. My grandfather had the most stories out of all of us. It’s like the ghosts were singling him out or something. But anyway, he grew up with them and it was common and accepted knowledge that the land was haunted even in his childhood! That’s as far back as I know, since my family only started on this land with my grandfather’s parents
There were stories of apparitions, sheets being pulled off of beds, disembodied voices. I theorize that they tried to get to my grandpa like they’ve gotten to me but he just kinda didn’t put up with it/ignored it. He’s not reactionary, which I think saved him a lot of trouble.
*Hi sunny! Kinda off topic, kinda not; do you know if your grandma or grandpa ever interacted with Grim?*
I have no idea honestly. I think it was my aunt that told me Grim’s name but I have no idea how she knew that information. Maybe that’s just what she called it?
*Maybe, it's pretty common for black dogs to receive morbid names*
Perhaps. Grim didn’t act like a stray, I guess it being the stranger explains that…
Texting my aunt to ask why she calls it Grim
Aunt Jolene: I named the dog. I called him Grim like the bad omen because he showed up for the first time right before that hurricane hit and blew that tree on my RV.
*Didn't the Stranger say it was a warning when you first met?!?!*
Yeah it did
*Is the RV she's talking about the trailer that's all freaky? Or are they dif things*
Nah she got an RV so she could stay with my grandma sometimes before the tree fell on it
*Maybe going a bit too specific but do you know what kind of tree fell on the RV?*
I believe it was a big branch from one of the trees around my grandmas house I have no idea what kind they are

![[Map.png]]
The land is so much more massive than this I just had no idea how to fit it. I left out the bunny trail and the whole trail on the way in where I found Grim for the first time
There are also several trails through the woods I didn’t include
*hey sunny, where is the water well in relation to all of this?*
Right beside my grandmas house

No I haven’t heard anything, does anyone know what the note says? Or what it looks like?

Does it have to be terrifyingly ominous every time? :,)
*Sunny how do I oh think the stranger got the phone to film these videos*
I think it’s someone else’s phone from one of the earlier generations.
It’s definitely not my grandma’s phone, she’s serious about her technology
She loves her iPad probably more than she loves me
*What phone was it using before?*
So I’ve actually never seen the phone
I know it was using my phone for a while when I went ghost mode
But before that and after that, I have no clue

*Hey sunny are you currently at your grandma's place? Or when were you last there?*

*The playlists name is cycles since sunny so we are trying to figure out what cycles are being meant*
When I last saw it, things were really weird and crazy. I remember hearing it talk to… something? Someone? And then radio silence until now


---

Auggie vague and ominous
There is a theme to the video
*does Stranger sometimes j ignore things if they think weve already asked that question*
Sometimes the Stranger doesn’t respond because it genuinely does not know the answer or it doesn’t know what it is being asked and is trying to make sense of the word combination. It has a hard time explaining exactly why its confused so if the information is something it isn’t 100% positive on, it freezes up and doesn’t know quite how to respond
*Better to rephrase?*
This exactly. If you’re getting no where, try saying it in completely different ways and something might just click and get you the answer you are looking for. It’s like having a ring full of keys and trying to see which one fits.
*Hey Dungeon Master, do electrinocs work in Mist World(TM)*
hmmm, depends on how you're using them
Also, regarding "i'm your only friend"... think about the order of events in which they happened before you reverse the audio.
There is a hole that needs patching. One thing isn't adding up. Can you find it?
Sometimes the order of things isn't what you think it is
but something doesn't make sense does it? One of these things is not like the other
Try to think of it like a word scramble. There are two different timelines that are happening simultaneosly. Separate them and discuss each one
Okay as much as I made it sound super complicated ALSO don't overthink it
Sunny - Crying, trust, skip. Digging, thud, covering, walking, car, music.
Other - As you heard it.
Apply what I said to the roots up
There is one big question that isnt being asked
count the doors. how many have been opened? how many havent?
I'm talking throughout this entire web-series
Okay I'm gonna say one more thing and then suggest y'all come back to the doors at another time because there's something else that's more important to discuss first:
Which came first? The chicken? Or the egg?
That's the last thing on the doors
Something about Sunny's order of events doesn't quite add up
Can you figure out what that is?
the seeds have been planted, but don't trust what you see on the surface to the second power

It's a cage
I wonder who built that and for what purpose
BLOCKED BY LUMBER
Hm. Written things. Written things are important. Didn’t we see some written things today? (26/11/23)

_oooOoOOoOoO_ 
Every little inconsistency is intentional
_OAOOoOoOoOOoOo_

Here is your first hint: The question you are trying to answer has been asked before. Back when things were _simple_ 
The question you have already been asked is the bones of this one. It’s just a little dressed up now.

It’s the same question But worded differently
What is being questioned here? What is the base of what we are deciding here?

Your second and final hint: 
There is a good ending. 
And there is a bad ending. 
As a bonus question for thought relating to the first hint: what has been called to question on and off throughout the series? Something important. Don’t think too hard about it, it’s right at the surface. Good luck everyone this has been so fun
No this series has masses of lore that haven’t even been touched yet 😵‍💫

You chose the good ending <3
The question was whether or not to trust the stranger, which was a very important decision that you all made way back in 2021. The question of whether or not to wear the necklace is basically deciding whether or not we are putting our faith in the stranger. This decision to wear the necklace has created a trust bond between the Stranger and Sunny that will really help the future of this series. 
Essentially, the question “do we trust the stranger” is dressed up in a choice that essentially reveals whether we as a collective do or don’t truly trust it
The other ending would have prolonged the stranger’s suffering and would have created a rift / divide between Sunny and the Stranger, isolating both of them further
Defeating the \[REDACTED\] with the power of friendship

This one is one of the slightly more complicated puzzles, I believe in y’all tho you can do it
It’s canon that Sunny isn’t that bright. They really like to explore though!
The video puzzle still hasn’t been solved yet, so you’ll probably have something to do when you’re ready to get back into it 🫶
By the way, with the trail cam video, I will let y’all know once you’ve solved it 🫶
Just waking up and I wanted to let y’all know that y’all solved it
There are currently… 28 named characters in Follow The Dog and more are being written
*¿Is Grim included in this figure?*
Yea!
¿Is ✨Mist Voice✨ included in this figure?
Something like that
*And how many of the names/characters could we know about?*
You’ll know all of them eventually but for now its a small portion of that list

*Hey @Sunny, while we’ve got you here, ¿what would happen if we showed Sunny a photograph or video of you? ¿How would they react?*
The entire project will be shut down because Sunny’s brain will break :3 /j
Sunny is now in therapy so let’s let that have some kind of an effect before we ruin Sunny’s life again /j
We will touch on what those therapy sessions look like very soon
*i know whos baptist dead*

ELLA JUST GIFTED ME SOMETHING ON A CERTAIN…. GAMING ENGINE…. 
Pressurized gas 😏
 That is going to speed up the process of a very certain FTD project
The song “Interdimensional” on the FTD Playlist is about The Mother Aaaaaaaand “The Diner” is there from the perspective of [REDACTED] to Florence GTG BYYYYEEEEE
(sunny just cries. "Birdhouse in your soul" plays in the distance, getting louder)
**The mother** But it's so easy to get free.
The fact that all of our screenshots are from drastically different parts of the narrative and even different projects within the universe
While I’m here, as of this afternoon, we have a brand new cast member! (26/5/24)
We already have a Marcy Todd actually! Forgot to announce that🫢but this one is new new
This cast member is 47 years old if that gives any kind of hint
"a little more twink-y" - august greenwood 2024

found clues

I have avian information (a little birdie told me). The songs all being by They Might Be Giants is not a coincidence. “There is a reason. And it’s important”. This should clear up any misunderstanding that it’s _just_ because August and Sushi like that band or whatever.

The years that songs have released may also be important. I remember that the first song we found related to the year that it released.

Tmbg songs listed in order of appearance: 
From **Nanobots**, 2013 
Stuff is way (from stranger in basement) 
You’re on fire (from chips # after texting “exodus”) 
From **Flood**, 1990 
Theme from flood (backwards from well) 
Sapphire bullets of pure love (from Florence note) Birdhouse in your soul (digging video) 
From **BOOK**, 2021 
I broke my own rule (back of Florence note)

Characters with Actors: 
Sunny - August Greenwood 
The Stranger (🐄) - Sushi Soucy 
Grim - Lexi the dog, RIP
✨Mist Voice✨ - Joshua Turchin 
Sophie - Ella

confirmed in this audio so far:
sunny = crying
sophie = singing and calling for marcy
stranger (🐄) = calling(?) for sunny

Mace’s 2nd text conversation, with +1 (843) 640-5940: **You're poking your nose in places they shouldn't be, Mace** 
Well I’m Curious- and stubborn 
**Have you tried looking for Sunny outside at night? Have you tried that? I’ve heared the moon is beautiful out tonight.**

Ella’s 2nd text conversation with +1 (843) 640-5940 
🤨

CW: this audio implies a lot dark themes as to what may be happening- be warned going into it. If you don't want to risk it I'll try to type up a description of what we are hearing so people who are nervous about listening can have an idea of what's going on [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1chzK-9ZEdRYNC5C1NqlSmDTe54WIcCIP/view?usp=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1chzK-9ZEdRYNC5C1NqlSmDTe54WIcCIP/view?usp=drivesdk "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1chzK-9ZEdRYNC5C1NqlSmDTe54WIcCIP/view?usp=drivesdk")

I thought it looked familiar - that says "You're poking your nose in places they shouldn't be" again

*why is there a window in the basement*
Thats not quite the basement


“Someone” 
“I don’t” 
“Happened” 
“To me” 
“I’m looking”
I think that’s what it says

I’m going to list the characters that I can remember off the top of my head. This list will be updated to include more characters as I am just one woman. 
Grim 
Sunny 
Stranger 
Sophie 
Marcy
John 
Sunny’s Grandma  (Helen)
✨Mist Voice✨(?)
Mother 
Marvin (sunny's grandpa)
Chip Perry 
Denise 
Michael 
Sunny’s Aunt
Ludos
Florence

Why do all the bad things happen at once? Do bad things happen to good people or is this some kind of punishment? (Some days) I wonder if I’m truly good (after everything) My father says that god knows. God always knows. I wonder what he thinks about. I try to be good. I (really really) do but I’m… 
My father is going to…


Sophie Perry had many dreams, one of which was to sing in her church choir.
Another was to grow up.
