Name: Marvin
Dug the [[Lake]] by hand.
Also built [[Grandma's house]] himself
Married to [[Sunny's Grandma - Helen]]

Grandpa lake
He dug it forever ago. He built the house I’m staying in. He and his buddies all got together and dug the [[Basement]] and built most of the [[Barn|barns]] on this land
I’m pretty sure the house started getting built in like 1999-2001 but he had been working on this land for ages before that

Sunny's jean jacket belonged to him, and was given to them by [[Sunny's Grandma - Helen]] to remember him by.

Someone mentioned that the user 364 account made a post with a car and a garage, and asked if the picture looked familiar, and Sunny said it was his car.

A picture was sent of old car parts to the stranger with the question who it belonged to, and it responded that it belonged to Marvin.

Marvin was not driving the car in the video
Marvin was not in danger

Marvin's parents had a house at [[Mailbox Plot]] that had been there and was renovated from as far back as the 1800's. That is where Marvin grew up. Later they movied, Marvin got married and the house got bulldozed and torn down, but for some reason the mailbox stayed. It might have been used for the [[Trailer]].

Later Marvin revisited the land and decided he really wanted to build a farm house there for his family. He was a farmer as well as a car engineer (for Ford). Around 1999 he started mapping out and drawing blueprints for the new house and that lasted until about 2001 when he just started clearing and landscaping the land while he was saving up money and materials for the construction. I think he started actually building around 2005-2006 and this includes all of the barns and the lake / gazebo / bridge /dock

Marvin had the most ghost stories out of all of the family. It’s like the ghosts were singling him out or something. But anyway, he grew up with them and it was common and accepted knowledge that the land was haunted even in his childhood! That’s as far back as I know, since my family only started on this land with my grandfather’s parents
There were stories of apparitions, sheets being pulled off of beds, disembodied voices. I theorize that they tried to get to my grandpa like they’ve gotten to me but he just kinda didn’t put up with it/ignored it. He’s not reactionary, which I think saved him a lot of trouble.

There is this one ghost story my grandma told me when I was younger. Whenever my marvin first built the house on this land, she was home alone and went outside to hang up some laundry on the clothes line when she heard a high pitched voice calling out the name “Rosie! Rosie!” She looked and looked and nobody was there.

He never mentioned [[John]] to Sunny.
