First mentioned in [[Neighbours house red roof 1]].
He was asked whether he remembered [[John]] as he hadn't been heard from in a few weeks. To let [[Sunny's Grandpa - Marvin]] know if he saw his car coming down the road. And that he is always welcome at their house.

Sunny remembered that Michael used to live in the [[Neighbours house red roof]]. She has no idea if he still lives there or not. She swam in their pool when she was a kid. She doesn't remember Michael much, but his wife [[Jackie]] was always so nice to Sunny. She doesn't know if Jackie still lives there, but if she does, Michael probably does too. It has always been their house but they either haven't talked to them or about them for a long time or they moved.
