Wife of [[Michael]]. Lives or lived in [[Neighbours house red roof]], Sunny isn't sure if they still do. She swam in their pool when she was a kid, but remember Jackie always being so nice to her.
It has always been their house but they either haven't talked to them or about them for a long time or they moved.
