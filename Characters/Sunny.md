Sunny is the main character in this adventure. 
It all starts when Sunny finds a dog and starts to follow them randomly.
Sunny has a [[Sunny's Grandma||Grandma]] who she is staying with at the start of the story. She goes to follow the dog because there are acres and acres of land, with loads of abandoned barns perfect for exploring.

Sunny uses the viewers to make choices, should or should she not do something, which location should she go to, and open questions.
During the first location choice, she sees someone sitting at a [[Barn]], so when the viewers vote to go there, she goes closer but doesn't recognise the person. The now dubbed [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] smiles weirdly and Sunny bolts, thus marking the first meeting.

The other location was the [[Gazebo]], which is where Sunny goes next. It is revealed to have been where her parents got married. At the Gazebo, the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] appears and says "I wouldn't step foot in that if I were you"

After that Sunny goes to look for the dog and the Stranger again to question them. During the search Sunny reveals that she has an [[Sunny's Aunt|Aunt]] that told them the dog is a frequent visitor. The dog is male and his name is [[Grimm]].

Having found the dog, she follows him to an abandoned [[Trailer]] where the dog disappears again. The majority votes to look for the dog but it starts pouring rain. During this rain pour Sunny asks the viewers for theories, where a viewer points out a person in the woods during a clip where they are searching for Grimm.

Sunny gets some treats for Grimm at the store. She goes to find him, but gets an eerie feeling of being watched. When she arrives at the [[Mailbox Plot]], she reveals that there used to be a house there but her Great grandparents tore it down and moved away. She calls it a hotspot.

After finding Grimm and leaving him with his bone, she asks the viewers where she should go, and they choose the [[Barn]]. She describes it and the nearby field. She also points out a nearby wreckage of what looks like a tractor and calls out for the stranger near the barn to no avail. Sunny returns home. 

Because Sunny is thirsty and the fridge with water is in the creepy [[Basement]], Sunny asks the viewers whether they should go. With the majority voting yes, Sunny quickly goes to grab the water while talking about how creepy it is, turns around to see the Stranger, so she runs and locks herself in the downstairs bathroom. With some convincing she returns to the basement and talks to the stranger.

Sunny leaves, no longer feeling safe in this house. However, she also asks the viewers what she should ask it when she can get ahold of it again.
When she is making a snack in the kitchen, she sees the stranger waving at her. She goes and talks to it, and it directs her to the basement. Sunny first goes to their room to work op the courage but then goes to the [[Basement]].
