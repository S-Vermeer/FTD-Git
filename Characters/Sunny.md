Sunny is the main character in this adventure. 
It all starts when Sunny finds a dog and starts to follow them randomly.
Sunny has a [[Sunny's Grandma||Grandma]] who she is staying with at the start of the story. She goes to follow the dog because there are acres and acres of land, with loads of abandoned barns perfect for exploring.

Sunny uses the viewers to make choices, should or should she not do something, which location should she go to, and open questions.
During the first location choice, she sees someone sitting at a [[Barn]], so when the viewers vote to go there, she goes closer but doesn't recognise the person. The now dubbed [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] smiles weirdly and Sunny bolts, thus marking the first meeting.

The other location was the [[Gazebo]], which is where Sunny goes next. It is revealed to have been where her parents got married. At the Gazebo, the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] appears and says "I wouldn't step foot in that if I were you"

After that Sunny goes to look for the dog and the Stranger again to question them. During the search Sunny reveals that she has an [[Sunny's Aunt|Aunt]] that told them the dog is a frequent visitor. The dog is male and his name is [[Grimm]].

Having found the dog, she follows him to an abandoned [[Trailer]] where the dog disappears again. The majority votes to look for the dog but it starts pouring rain. During this rain pour Sunny asks the viewers for theories, where a viewer points out a person in the woods during a clip where they are searching for Grimm.

Sunny gets some treats for Grimm at the store. She goes to find him, but gets an eerie feeling of being watched. When she arrives at the [[Mailbox Plot]], she reveals that there used to be a house there but her Great grandparents tore it down and moved away. She calls it a hotspot.

After finding Grimm and leaving him with his bone, she asks the viewers where she should go, and they choose the [[Barn]]. She describes it and the nearby field. She also points out a nearby wreckage of what looks like a tractor and calls out for the stranger near the barn to no avail. Sunny returns home. 

Because Sunny is thirsty and the fridge with water is in the creepy [[Basement]], Sunny asks the viewers whether they should go. With the majority voting yes, Sunny quickly goes to grab the water while talking about how creepy it is, turns around to see the Stranger, so she runs and locks herself in the downstairs bathroom. With some convincing she returns to the basement and talks to the stranger.

Sunny leaves, no longer feeling safe in this house. However, she also asks the viewers what she should ask it when she can get ahold of it again.
When she is making a snack in the kitchen, she sees the stranger waving at her. She goes and talks to it, and it directs her to the basement. Sunny first goes to their room to work op the courage but then goes to the [[Basement]]. 

Sunny finds 12 notes with a morse code of Sophie in the basement as well as a document with a docs link. 

Sunny is debating whether or not to trust the stranger. She is not as scared of it as she used to be, but is unsure if it is pulling her into a trap or helping her.

Was searching in the [[Basement]] during the day to spot anything she missed, sees opened bag of canine carry outs on the ground. These are the dog treats she got for [[Grimm]], they are open and half of them are gone. They don't have any pets in the house.

Goes to see grim, walking over a sunny path with a positive attitude. Has brought the treats.

Sunny finds tiny little headstones at the side of the field. Grimm is gone. The [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] shows up and says that it is a [[Pet Cemetery]]. Sunny is frightened because the stranger snuck up on her. Scene cut and then Sunny goes to explain and Grimm is back and the stranger is nowhere to be found. 
Walking home, Sunny explains that before disappearing, the stranger explained that the pet cemetery belonged to 'the man in trailer'. Sunny points out the [[Trailer]], saying that it means that a man used to live there and she is not going to investigate there now because she is not in the mood to deal with whatever scary things are there. She doesn't know if someone is living in there right now. Based on this clue, Sunny wants to do research on who lived there before and whether they knew [[Sophie Perry|Sophie]] and whether Sophie had anything to do with the trailer.

Grimm is walking home, done for the day. Sunny says she is going to do some more investigating.

Sunny sitting in front of something where a paper written in red crayon is visible. It says [[Grocery]] and the amounts as well as the O for onions show the number combination 8439046517. Sunny thanks everyone for the art and the help, and suggests making a discord to solve the mystery together and talk to others who want to solve it. 

 Is about to go to the barn, because everyone wants her to. Throat is hurting and she's not feeling too great.

Sun is setting while she is approaching the [[Barn]]. Keeps hearing barking, but that is not that unusual around here because there's a lot of dogs in the area and they do have neighbours. Sunny is getting very bad vibes at the barn. Decides to take a break and go somewhere else first. 


Shows the [[Gazebo]] and the path that goes around the [[Lake]]. Mentions that her [[Sunny's Grandpa||Grandpa]] dug this lake by hand. 
#TS: 27:53, Sunny is frightened, asking us if we heard that. Goes really quiet and at #TS: 28:15 we hear something high pitched. Sunny asks us to tell her what it is, hoping it is a bird.
#TS: 28:26. Sees a [[Backpack]] on the [[Bridge]] near the [[Gazebo]]. Mentions that it was not here the other day. Takes it with her.
#TS: 28:32. Quiet, mentions how the vibes are horrible 'out here'. Searched the whole [[Backpack]] and found a very upsetting message. [[Backpack Marcy Todd 1]]. Sunny reads the note to us.
#TS: 29:23. It is getting dark, and she doesn't feel comfortable being out here for too much longer, but sunny asks us in an open chat box whether there is anything else she should do. In the caption she also says that there is another note in the [[Backpack]]. ^ocb-5
#TS: 29:34. Has a note in her hand. Says how it sounds nuts but she would feel a lot safer if the stranger would show up.

A response to the chatbox is to 'Go around the trailer and try to see if theres any movement around'. Sunny says she would but the trailer is pretty far away and the sun is very much setting. Isn't really ready to be out there in the complete dark.
Another response is to check if there is anything in the bag. Shows a flashlight, which was the only other thing found in the bag. 
Another response was to go back home, then read the rest of the note there if you feel safer :). Sunny mentions how the last thing she wants to do is disappoint us. 

#TS: 30:25, points out to where the trailer is, is debating going but is unsure. 
Thanks everyone who voted No, and goes to read the second note found in the [[Backpack]] [[Backpack Marcy Todd 2]]. Sunny summarizes that the [[Backpack]] probably belonged to [[Marcy Todd]]. She thinks the placement of the [[Backpack]] was purposeful for her to see. Thinks the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] put it on the [[Bridge]] for Sunny to see. 

#TS: 31:32. Calls out because someone has been knocking. In the bathroom (?). When she opens the door no one is there, but there is a note on the ground, written in red crayon saying 222 church street on one side and Go ! :) on the other. Sunny assumes that the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] wrote it due to the handwriting and red crayon, and that it wants her to go to the location. Mentions how she does have a car and can drive there. Says how she is going to keep her car doors locked at all times, not going out of the car and carrying pepper spray.
#TS: 32:37. Says she lied about getting out of the car. Shows the [[Trinity Church]]. It is very spooky looking especially at night. It does not look burnt down, but behind what is visible it is completely destroyed. There is a barbed wire fence around it. Against the fence there is a note ([[Math - gewswz]]) on the ground. 
#TS 33:17. Sunny is puzzled because it has math on the back. 

#TS: 33:57, Sunny came outside and the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] is just standing there by the [[Lake]]. Per suggestion of the discord to befriend the stranger, has brought a gift. It is a plushie with a horn (narwhal?) Stranger goes to eat the horn, but Sunny stops it. Stranger looks at it and says "Cow". Sunny says that it is not a cow, that's Phillip. Stranger goes to pat it, and says "Cow" again. Sunny laughs a little and says, yeah. Cow. 

#TS: 34:46. [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] suggests that Sunny should go to the [[Trailer]]. Sunny asks "right now?" and the stranger nods. Sunny grabs a golf cart and goes away.
