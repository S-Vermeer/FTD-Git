Grimm is the best boy, Played by the best girl, Lexi, may she rest in peace.
We first see Grimm in the opening of our story, together with another dog. Sunny goes to follow Grimm, to explore the land. 

Sunny goes to find Grimm again but can't find him (TS 6:50). Sunny reveals that the dog's name is Grimm after talking to her [[Sunny's Aunt|Aunt]]. After a bit of calling, Grimm comes running. He leads her to an abandoned trailer and disappears. Sunny wants to go look for him, but it starts pouring.

Sunny went to the grocery store to get treats for Grimm and later spots him near where he hangs out, taking a nap in the sun. Grimm gets a bone for being such a good boy and goes back to relaxing.
