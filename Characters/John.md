Used to live in the [[Trailer]], according to [[Sunny's Grandma - Helen]]

Several notes addressed to him were found at the [[Trailer]], namely [[Crawl space Trailer 1]], [[Crawl space Trailer 2]], [[Crawl space Trailer 3]], [[Crawl space Trailer 4]].

John helped build the [[Basement]] according to [[Crawl space Trailer 1]]
John was supposed to dig the hole for the [[Well]] and watch over the house while [[Sunny's Grandpa - Marvin]] was away for a week according to [[Crawl space Trailer 2]]
The [[Well]] was finished when [[Sunny's Grandpa - Marvin]] came back after a week, despite it being estimated to take 2-3 months according to [[Crawl space Trailer 3]]
John wasn't seen for a while according to [[Crawl space Trailer 4]]

Sunny hadn't heard of John before this, [[Sunny's Grandpa - Marvin]] never mentioned him. In the [[Elsewhere]] Sunny saw John, and he and [[Sunny's Grandpa - Marvin]] seemed to get along super well. When those two were talking, he was wearing Blue Overalls. This was found in the discord chats as described by Sunny.

[[Sunny's Grandpa - Marvin]] asked [[Michael]] whether he had seen John as he hadn't been seen in a few weeks. He never picked up the cash from helping build the [[Well]] and his car is gone. This was found in [[Neighbours house red roof 1]].

Side note, apparently the people from They might be Giants are also both called John.
