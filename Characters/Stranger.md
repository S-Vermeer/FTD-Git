- firstSeenAt [[Barn]]

The stranger first shows up, sitting outside the [[Barn]]. Due to it smiling weirly, Sunny gets scared and bolts. When Sunny returns to go to the Gazebo, the Stranger has disappeared. 

When Sunny goes to step foot into the [[FTD-Git/Locations/Gazebo]], the Stranger appears behind her and says "I wouldn't step foot in that if I were you." before disappearing again. (TS 5:58)

When Sunny is looking for Grimm, the stranger can be seen in the woods in the background, coming closer.

Sunny goes to look for the Stranger at the barn, but he doesn't appear when she calls to him.

When Sunny has to go to the [[Basement]] to grab some water, the Stranger appears behind her. She gets spooked and locks herself in the bathroom. 
When she decides to go talk to it based on votes she thinks the stranger has disappeared, then a bell goes off in the other room, the screen gets distorted and the stranger is peeking behind the doorpost. 
"Who are you" "I am what they have (not) / (lost)"
"Who is they" "I am here and they have left"
"What are you" "A warning"
"Who is here" #TS 13:42 #morse {Answer}.

Sunny is in the kitchen making herself a snack and sees the stranger just standing there outside the window, waving at her. After a vote she approaches it and asks if it wants to talk. Stranger responds with "Did I scare you?" Sunny asks "Yesterday?" in reply. Stranger confirms. Sunny replies "Yes, very badly." The stranger tilts its head down at this. Sunny asks whether it is okay, and whether it has a name. It shakes its head in reply. Sunny asks "Would you like one" and it shakes its head. It says "Go check the [[Basement]]." Sunny asks "Are you going to scare me again". The stranger replies "Not on purpose."

Once Sunny is in the basement, the lights go off in the hallway, then we see the stranger turning off the lights for the main room of the [[Basement]]. Once Sunny enters the basement, the stranger is gone. Sunny turns around, mentions a photo that always creeps her out #TS 17:15, turns back around while turning on the lights and the Stranger is sitting in the chair.
Sunny says "Hi, where am I looking". The Stranger has a staring contest with Sunny and then simply replies: "Yes :)"

In the [[Basement]], continuation after [[Videos 1||Episode 1]].
[[Sunny]] asks the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] what she is looking for. The stranger responds with "You'll know"
#TS: 18:02 
There is a paper in a white miniature house/church thing. Sunny shows it to the stranger and asks whether this is it, the stranger replies to "keep looking, there's more". 
#TS: 18:20 #morse `... --- .--. .... .. .` : Translation = [[Sophie Perry|Sophie Perry]]. Sunny asks if it is the same morse code as before (end of episode 1), and the stranger responds with yeah. It has moved from the chair to the doorway.

While Sunny is asking where to look next, the stranger appears behind her and says 'There's twelve' two times.

After her search she also finds [[Basement Docs]] which appears to have been written by the stranger due to the red crayon, childlike writing.
The stranger is no longer in the room. Sunny calls out to it whether she can ask it about it, but no response.

Sunny is debating whether or not to trust the stranger. She is not as scared of it as she used to be, but is unsure if it is pulling her into a trap or helping her.

#TS: 24:34. Sunny finds tiny little headstones at the side of the field. [[Grimm]] is gone. The stranger shows up and says that it is a [[Pet Cemetery]]. Sunny is frightened because the stranger snuck up on her. Scene cut and then Sunny goes to explain and Grimm is back and the stranger is nowhere to be found. 
#TS: 25:03 Walking home, Sunny explains that before disappearing, the stranger explained that the pet cemetery belonged to 'the man in trailer'. Sunny points out the [[Trailer]], saying that it means that a man used to live there and she is not going to investigate there now because she is not in the mood to deal with whatever scary things are there. She doesn't know if someone is living in there right now. Based on this clue, Sunny wants to do research on who lived there before and whether they knew [[Sophie Perry]] and whether Sophie had anything to do with the trailer.

#TS: 26:07. Sunny sitting in front of something where a paper written in red crayon is visible. It says [[Grocery]] and the amounts as well as the O for onions show the number combination 8439046517. 

#TS: 31:32. Calls out because someone has been knocking. In the bathroom (?). When she opens the door no one is there, but there is a note on the ground, written in red crayon saying 222 church street on one side and Go ! :) on the other. Sunny assumes that the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] wrote it due to the handwriting and red crayon, and that it wants her to go to the location

#TS: 33:57, Sunny came outside and the stranger is just standing there by the [[Lake]]. Per suggestion of the discord to befriend the stranger, has brought a gift. It is a plushie with a horn (narwhal?) Stranger goes to eat the horn, but Sunny stops it. Stranger looks at it and says "Cow". Sunny says that it is not a cow, that's Phillip. Stranger goes to pat it, and says "Cow" again. Sunny laughs a little and says, yeah. Cow. 

#TS: 34:46. stranger suggests that Sunny should go to the [[Trailer]]. Sunny asks "right now?" and the stranger nods. Sunny grabs a golf cart and goes away.
