The stranger first shows up, sitting outside the [[Barn]]. Due to it smiling weirly, Sunny gets scared and bolts. When Sunny returns to go to the Gazebo, the Stranger has disappeared. 

When Sunny goes to step foot into the [[Gazebo]], the Stranger appears behind her and says "I wouldn't step foot in that if I were you." before disappearing again. (TS 5:58)

When Sunny is looking for Grimm, the stranger can be seen in the woods in the background, coming closer.

Sunny goes to look for the Stranger at the barn, but he doesn't appear when she calls to him.

When Sunny has to go to the [[Basement]] to grab some water, the Stranger appears behind her. She gets spooked and locks herself in the bathroom. 
When she decides to go talk to it based on votes she thinks the stranger has disappeared, then a bell goes off in the other room, the screen gets distorted and the stranger is peeking behind the doorpost. 
"Who are you" "I am what they have (not) / (lost)"
"Who is they" "I am here and they have left"
"What are you" "A warning"
"Who is here" #TS 13:42 #morse {Answer}.

Sunny is in the kitchen making herself a snack and sees the stranger just standing there outside the window, waving at her. After a vote she approaches it and asks if it wants to talk. Stranger responds with "Did I scare you?" Sunny asks "Yesterday?" in reply. Stranger confirms. Sunny replies "Yes, very badly." The stranger tilts its head down at this. Sunny asks whether it is okay, and whether it has a name. It shakes its head in reply. Sunny asks "Would you like one" and it shakes its head. It says "Go check the [[Basement]]." Sunny asks "Are you going to scare me again". The stranger replies "Not on purpose."

Once Sunny is in the basement, the lights go off in the hallway, then we see the stranger turning off the lights for the main room of the [[Basement]]. Once Sunny enters the basement, the stranger is gone. Sunny turns around, mentions a photo that always creeps her out #TS 17:15, turns back around while turning on the lights and the Stranger is sitting in the chair.
Sunny says "Hi, where am I looking". The Stranger has a staring contest with Sunny and then simply replies: "Yes :)"
