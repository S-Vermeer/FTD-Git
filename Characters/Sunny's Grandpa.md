Name: Marvin
Dug the [[Lake]] by hand.
Also built the house himself

Grandpa lake
He dug it forever ago. He built the house I’m staying in. He and his buddies all got together and dug the [[Basement]] and built most of the [[Barn|barns]] on this land
I’m pretty sure the house started getting built in like 1999-2001 but he had been working on this land for ages before that
