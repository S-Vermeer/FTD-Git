The math note revealed the code word 'exodus' to text to chip. After you text 'exodus' to Chip, we get [[Exodus Docs]], which is a document encrypted with a vigenere cipher with the codeword 'Chip' to reveal the lyrics to the song You're on fire from TMBG - [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0gFECzmDLrI&feature=youtu.be](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0gFECzmDLrI&feature=youtu.be "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0gFECzmDLrI&feature=youtu.be")
