Pastor at the [[Trinity Church]].
Father to [[Sophie Perry]]
Used to have a jean jacket that Sophie was wearing when she went missing.


Description obtained from [[Newspaper Clippings]] which were sent by [[Phone number Chip Perry]] as was confirmed in the clippings and found on the [[Grocery]] note and the [[Math - gewswz]] note. The math note revealed the code word 'exodus' to text to chip. After you text 'exodus' to Chip, we get [[Exodus Docs]], which is a document encrypted with a vigenere cipher with the codeword 'Chip' to reveal the lyrics to the song You're on fire from TMBG - [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0gFECzmDLrI&feature=youtu.be](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0gFECzmDLrI&feature=youtu.be "https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0gFECzmDLrI&feature=youtu.be")

Suspected to have written [[Backpack Marcy Todd 1]] and [[Backpack Marcy Todd 2]] due to the reference of a parent of Sophie and the religious references.

[[Sunny's Grandma - Helen]] said the name sounded familiar, but that it was a very small town.
