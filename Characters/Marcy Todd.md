First mentioned in [[Backpack Marcy Todd 1]] and [[Backpack Marcy Todd 2]] notes that were found at a backpack 

The notes revealed they were in contact with [[Sophie Perry]], much to the dislike of a parent of Sophie, probably [[Chip Perry]]. According to them Marcy was 'skilled in the ways of the devil' and 'influencing' Sophie to give in to sin.

Marcy is described as having piercings.

They are blamed for Sophie's disappearance, as they left her unattended.
They are accused of being off doing drugs somewhere.
According to the note, they have not been in [[Trinity Church|church]] to seek forgiveness, possibly since the disappearance but perhaps longer.
