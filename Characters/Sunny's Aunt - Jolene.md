Sunny asked her aunt about the dog, and she said she sees that dog a lot around here. It is a male dog and his name is [[Grimm]]. (TS 6:50)

Aunt Jolene: I named the dog. I called him Grim like the bad omen because he showed up for the first time right before that hurricane hit and blew that tree on my RV.

She has a cat called Calli who appears in a few videos

She doesn't believe Sunny about the stranger
