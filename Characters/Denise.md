- [ ] Where did Denise live? Was there a house at the pet cemetery?  
First mentioned in [[Note Pet Cemetery 1]], where she is welcomed to the neighbourhood. 

She got a pie from [[Sunny's Grandma - Helen|Helen]] and [[Sunny's Grandpa - Marvin]] says that they are always a hop skip and a jump away.

The name Denise was not recognized by Sunny.

In the discord the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]] responded to 'does Denise sound familiar' with cow, meaning yes.
