Can be deduced from [[Grocery]]. 
(843) 904- 5517 -> Phone number that gave us the "There are 12 of Us " morse code message in audio as well as the [[Newspaper Clippings]]
In the newspaper clippings it mentions it being the number of [[Chip Perry]], father to [[Sophie Perry]].
Texting 'Exodus' to it, will get you the [[Exodus Docs]]
