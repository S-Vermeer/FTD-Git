Sunny kind of thought they were done with this series but is back at their Grandma's house and can't find [[Grimm]] in any of his usual spots. Doesn't react to calling his name for hours. Doesn't know how to continue follow the dog without the dog to follow. 

What should I do? ^ocb-7

Sunny apologies for last nights video. Is now in a better mood because they got a full night sleep. Has been here quite a few times since starting the series but wasn't in the head space to be filming it or documenting it. Is now doing much better. Started this series when she was only 17. Is 19 now. Believes they are different than when she was. Likes to think she has changed. Says it isn't about her but about the creepy weird stuff going on at her [[Grandma's house]].

question box says to look for the [[FTD-Git/Characters/Stranger|Stranger]]. Says it's a good idea because they haven't seen the stranger a single time this trip. Last time they came here when she wasn't documenting, it was everywhere. Is going to go around and do things that would usually get the stranger to come out. That is usually when she does something dangerous that it doesn't want Sunny to do or when Sunny is going around to spooky places that are high activity level.
