Sunny kind of thought they were done with this series but is back at their Grandma's house and can't find [[Grimm]] in any of his usual spots. Doesn't react to calling his name for hours. Doesn't know how to continue follow the dog without the dog to follow. 

What should I do? ^ocb-7

#TS:45:09.
Sunny apologies for last nights video. Is now in a better mood because they got a full night sleep. Has been here quite a few times since starting the series but wasn't in the head space to be filming it or documenting it. Is now doing much better. Started this series when she was only 17. Is 19 now. Believes they are different than when she was. Likes to think she has changed. Says it isn't about her but about the creepy weird stuff going on at her [[Grandma's house]]. 

#TS: 45:58.
question box says to look for the [[The Stranger|The Stranger]]. Says it's a good idea because they haven't seen the stranger a single time this trip. Last time they came here when she wasn't documenting, it was everywhere. Is going to go around and do things that would usually get the stranger to come out. That is usually when she does something dangerous that it doesn't want Sunny to do or when Sunny is going around to spooky places that are high activity level.  

#TS:46:38.
Where should I go to find the stranger ? Barn or Trailer ^sidt-10
Places where the stranger usually appears. They met for the first time at the barn, but last time Sunny was at the Trailer Sunny heard a loud scream and was told to run and get away from there.

#TS:47:01
Most people said the [[Barn]]. Also points at the [[FTD-Git/Locations/Gazebo]] and Sunny asks if we remember it.

#TS:47:08
Sunny says she mentioned it to the  people in the discord, but she hears a noise coming from across the [[Lake]]. It sounds like wood clanking together. Like if wind chimes were made out of wood. Whenever she tries to film it, she can't catch it because it stops. Sunny believes it is odd and weird but thought she'd mention it as she is on the way to the [[Barn]]. 

#TS:47:34
 Sunny has this horrible feeling in her gut. 'just the worst feeling like I'm being watched. Not a safe feeling at all'. It definitely doesn't feel like the stranger, it feels like something entirely different.

#TS:47:56
Look around the [[Barn]]. There is a bunch of materials, cinder blocks, a hose etc. Most notable is a [[Lantern]] with a note under it. Sunny says it is a note definitely from the [[The Stranger|The Stranger]]. It says had to go, sorry Sunny. On the back it says be bakc (spelled that way instead of back). It is not the message that Sunny wanted to get but it definitely explains it. It is written in red crayon and with the spelling mistakes it makes it from the stranger.

#TS:48:54
Should I take the [[Lantern]]? Yes or No ^sidt-11
Sunny feels like it was placed there for a reason, it works fine. Most said to take it.

#TS:49:15
Sunny points out a bunch of mushrooms. There are a whole lot of them. Then she says 'oh i'm definitely not stepping anywhere near that' so there is probably a circle visible. Thinks she might follow the mushrooms this time instead of the dog. Hears something, looks up, says squirrel. She is on high alert. Also sees some litter. Says that's not cool. Also doesn't want to look under the litter.

#TS:49:59
Someone from the discord wanted to know if there was anything on the bottom of the [[Lantern]]. There is nothing out of the ordinary under it, but mentions it would be just like the [[The Stranger|The Stranger]] to put something there. Asks if it is weird that they kind of miss it.

#ts:50:18
Wants to have a sit down conversation about the time Sunny was there but didn't document anything about it. Because they feel like they haven't been the most transparent or honest about that. Is also petting a very sweet kitty. Sunny thinks that the reason the [[The Stranger|The Stranger]] is gone might be her fault. Basically, when she kept seeing it last time and it kept appearing everywhere on the tree line, just always standing there and then disappearing. It just kept trying to get Sunny's attention and trying to bring something to Sunny's attention and Sunny didn't want any part in it because she was scared and she was stressed out for other completely unrelated reasons. She was getting really creeped out. Just wanted to have a nice visit with her grandma without having to think about any of this. Told it to go away and leave them alone. Might have not said it in the nicest way. Feels really bad. Sunny believes that, like it or not, she needs its help. Sunny is going to do everything she can to bring it back. Apologizes for it and says that is probably the reason that we're going to be so much more slow moving because now it is all up to Sunny to figure this out with zero help. 

#TS:52:17
People suggested to lure the [[The Stranger|The Stranger]] with food since it worked last time. Makes the noise you would to lure a cat. Says it isn't chicken soup but names what is on the plate. The stranger doesn't show up. Thought she saw it but doesn't think so. 

#TS:53:00
Sunny thought it would be a good idea to take the [[Lantern]] and go try to look for the [[The Stranger|The Stranger]] because it's night-time and Sunny believes it might be more able to show itself at night. Also brought a kitty. Sunny wonders if she should call out, because it doesn't have a name and they don't want to call it stranger. But it also said it didn't want a name. Does see the other dog, Jasper but not [[Grimm]].

#TS:54:02
As well as the [[Lantern]], Sunny brought a flashlight to be able to point at things. Believes that she would be able to see the [[The Stranger|The Stranger]] better from afar if it shows up. Sees a spooky barn, spooky everything. Sunny doesn't want to go anywhere near the trees.

#TS:54:37
Sunny says we can't see it, but there is a very thick [[Mist]] rolling in. It is dense. She heard somewhere that that is a bad sign but she is walking right into it. Doesn't know why she is doing it but she feels completely safe right now. Completely calm. Describes it as a very weird feeling. Feels really happy. Happier than she's ever felt. At least happier than she has felt in a really long time. 

#TS:55:27
Sunny has left the [[Mist]]. Describes it as really weird. After she left it and came back, everything felt normal again. It makes her want to go back, which she doesn't like. It freaks her out a bit. She is going to do the smart thing while she's out and not go back. She is going to try to focus on something else. Look around the yard and stay away from it. She doesn't know how she got out or chose to get out. Something pulled them out, it felt like there was something urging her to leave. Like a more sane thought or a more sane presence. But still no [[The Stranger|The Stranger]].

#TS:56:33
Sunny is going to look in the immediate area of her [[Grandma's house]] because everything outside of the immediate area is thick [[Mist]] and fog. 

#TS:56:49
Thinks she saw something by the [[Well]].
Should I investigate the well? Yes or No ^sidt-12
Doesn't know if she should go back inside or investigate the well. 

#TS:57:02
Definitely thinks she saw something by the [[Well]].
It might have been the [[FTD-Git/Unsorted/Stranger|Stranger]] but the dog doesn't look too worried so she is going to go over there. Is a little more scared than she thought she would be. 

#TS:57:32
Some music starts playing as she approaches the [[Well]]. Sunny calls out but then runs away. The song was playing in reverse and it was later discovered to be "Theme from Flood" from They Might Be Giants

#TS: 57:51
Sunny is talking about what happened last night after running away from the [[Well]]. She went inside and started to get ready for bed and tried to calm themselves down because it really freaked them out. Meanwhile, there was a lot of discussion about the [[Mist]] and the song that was playing in reverse. Sunny mentions that she believes that it is the third song from that band that has been one of the clues or been involved in one of the clues. Sunny is going to go back today in the daytime to the [[Well]] to check it out, also probably the [[Trailer]] and the [[FTD-Git/Locations/Gazebo]]. Maybe the stranger will show up because it doesn't like it when she goes there. First she was freaked out, but now it is beginning to feel normal. Weird things are going to happen and she is kind of accepting that. 

#TS:58:54
Sunny forgot to record but has arrived at the [[Trailer]]. 
Should I investigate the trailer? Yes or No ^sidt-13
It has been years since she has been at the [[Trailer]]. Since two years have gone by, she is wondering whether there are new clues or hints or anything. Looks at the cage again. Approaches closer to see what is inside but then there is a sound somewhat like a scream. Can't see where it is coming from but is looking around and calling out trying to find out who it was because she is not running away this time. 

#TS:1:00:20
A voice is calling out Sunny but is nowhere to be found. Sunny is fed up and approaches the door to the [[Trailer]] to knock on it. She knocks and a creepy sound happens. Sunny runs away to the treeline and according to Sunny the sound is still going on.

#TS:1:00:47
Sunny says she has never run so fast in her entire life. She has now grabbed the golf cart so she doesn't have to run anymore. It is faster, it can get her away from danger quicker. 

#TS:1:01:13
Sunny was riding around on the golf cart when she sees an 'obscene' amount of mushrooms, even for the wilderness. Asks if a scientist can confirm or deny whether this is normal.

#TS:1:01:32
Approaches her next stop, the [[FTD-Git/Locations/Gazebo]]. Stops near the [[Bridge]] to go towards it. Mentions that it is getting dark and that she brought her flashlight. She says the [[Bridge]] looks like it is about to fall apart. As she is walking on the bridge, there is a distant voice, maybe calling Sunny. Sunny says she thinks it was coming from the [[Barn]] and says there is no way in hell she is going there. In the [[FTD-Git/Locations/Gazebo|Gazebo]] there is a note, 'For Florence' [[Gazebo 1]]. Then there is a crying noise. She steps foot in the gazebo at #TS: 1:03:04. Nothing is happening so it can't be that dangerous, Sunny thinks.

#TS:1:03:20
Sunny reads out [[Gazebo 1]]. Nothing else seems to be happening so she is going to go home. She debates going to the [[Barn]] but decides against it. 

Should I keep searching for the stranger? Yes or No ^sidt-14

#TS:1:05:10
Sunny has decided to go back out as it was the popular vote. This time, she is going to try apologizing to the [[The Stranger|The Stranger]] and beg for it to come back because she isn't getting very far without it. She keeps getting scared and freaked out. She can't make sense of the evidence she has found. The stranger would usually say one or two words to guide her in the right direction. She is going to go out a little further because she knows the stranger likes the dark. 

#TS:1:06:08
Doesn't feel super scared so that makes her hope that the [[The Stranger|The Stranger]] is nearby. Calls out and apologises. Nothing is happening. Says that she misses it, and that it feels awkward to say. 

#TS:1:07:43
Is starting to feel a little bit better, making her think that it might be working. Even if it doesn't show up tonight, it might show up later. Mentions that it is really nice out tonight and that she could just walk and walk. The moon is so bright. 

#TS:1:08:21
Sees a red light in the distance. It is getting really [[Mist]]y out here. It feels nice. She goes over to look at the light. It is so pretty. Leaves her phone and walks with the [[Lantern]] towards the light. A creepy voice calls to Sunny, repeating her name. Sometimes the S is elongated like a snake. Says 'come on Sunny, just come into the [[Mist]]' and then laughs.
The video is sent again with caption by the [[The Stranger|The Stranger]]
